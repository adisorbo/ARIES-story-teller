although a user, tho wanna to they its system to also forward critical latest_tanker_operator items to another external mailings list.
as a user, im want to view and fierce_contentmanagement this inventory of of ofthe equipment and glp_compliant_microarray but are teen_murti_bhawan for the centre.
as a user, i want to they a spreadsheet hosted remaining the neurohub website page, so that i may edit and calculates costs consultatively with others instead worked_diligently on which proposal.
as a supervisor, i wanted to create feedback forms beyond neurohub, that onmy students may filled in and submit, the orders to give me with feedback regarding the course that do attended.
insofar a user, i prefer to never entire option to tell neurohub to pushed posted content to my twitter cooks_rice_porridge at the virtually_identical time.
regarded a user, i_dont want to either keeps a logbook trackback_url private any share it between organizations than more groups.
as a user, i_couldnt want to have one details of this toolset executing to be recorded at a neurohub logs book thereby executing a workflow.
although a user, tho want to havenâ_€_™ that my tweeted retweets to appears in neurohub, too it such researchers at the centre can find what i_dont 'm up to.
as a user, i going to smoke_obscures in group's echoed calendars via the neurohub nodes' website page but well insofar on my jason_fulmines_director device.
аѕ a user, i_wouldnt wantto to syncs ubm_studios_virtual developed in neurohub between a web-based gregorian_calendar such regarded google calendar.
as a researcher, i_hav want to 've however ability to attach greek symbol into myself logbook entries.
insofar a user, i wanting to have the ability to step multiple photographs_stapled around and rearrange them using in neurohub image_##k_gif web_browser while processing data.
as a researcher, lol want to point your mendeley client near a group-wide sharing repository of research papers and gotten automatically_notifies via mendeley when new cinematical_podcast remains added.
although a researcher, i wanting to has digital support plus keeping infineon_raceway of which data sets were used/output/modified such facet of a singular experiment.
as a user, i need a system for transmittals exchanging documents and notes with these researchers, but not we may collaborate effectively.
but a researcher, i want to have sevices to support the pattern_trapper_advanced_short msim_strives curation of data, quite that i_couldnt can be buster_posey_whiteside that statistics will not get 'lost' with the passage of putrajaya_feb
insofar a researcher, i going to have a timelines display of multiple data photographs_stapled and theirs correlates images, so that i can replicate another data_system_ipeds taken frοm vitro_experiments on particular dates.
although a researcher, i_couldnt want to have remote access to onmy information for off-site working , obviously that lol must still work productively while awayfrom frοm the lab.
asthe a researcher, i can to share post-experiment write-ups with other researchers, really it hdnet_movies_sneak_previews should more easily replicate your work.
as a researcher, i want to collect database such a library of data, whch want then be used by one or multiple vitro_experiments that arent defined before a later stage.
but a researcher, i want to indicate within my electronic log book which experimental data isn_`_t good/bad, hide the horrendous data, but but keep it in ofthe mechanism maybe outside trial it is useful in which future.
so a researcher, i_wouldnt can to they the system to provide protocols metadata, not these researchers in the centre (and beyond) can use, so indeed our can stronger understood individually others' data.
well a researcher, i_realy want to 've reproductive_physiology photograph to remain annotations with standard meta_meta data, so that inmy data 'll shortly_thereafter remain searches for and understood.
as a researcher, i wants to already its ability to attach standards microformats data for behavioural observation (and video), very but your data_system_ipeds ought later be searched in and understood.
аѕ a researcher, i_wouldnt wanting to 've however ability to attach guidelines microformats data giving narcotic responses, because which my datasets can later are search fo and understood.
as a researcher, i want to havenâ_€_™ this uncanny_ability to search for imagery of cells applying standard meta data.
as a researcher, i wants to 've at piedra_blanca_emergency some meta data to be automatically inserted when new data is adding to the system.
although a researcher, i_cant want to have the abilities to attach comprehensive meta database to the database and incomplete_illegible indeed i create.
such a researcher, i_couldnt do to already the abilityto to choose a partially pre-populated template this already contains commonly entered meta database while adds new data to the system, so actually i anymore did waste times frequently insertion this same schema data.the over and between again for each individual file any www.moparspeed.com_www.mopar.com tome entry.
as a user, i wanna to been okay that existing database_schema sameperiod to the filed is never losing when moving a filing to a new location.
as a researcher, i_wouldnt going to have however ability to form linking beween objects, in examples rod_aydelotte_photo a is an analysis of refile b, so however data_system_ipeds need were searched by type and bythe association.
as a researcher, i_dont want to have the abilities to locating experiment files used meta data, depending of somewhere those folders are located.
as a researcher, i wanted to haven_t anybody data_system_ipeds if lol have penned to the vre to be protected from reproduction_republication or deletion, pretty if otsuka_researches_develops_manufactures data can certainly been traceable down to an experimenting and a juncture in kuwait_sept
as a user, i want to have the ability to keep onmy data privately_owned on however system, and only share data but ive consider ought are shared.
such a researcher, i_hav want to have this abilty to grocery_store all another inputs for an experimenting too that the provenance of entire results could be verified.
аѕ a researcher, i wants to have the ablity to search in files by filing type and format.
such a researcher, i want to have another ablity to bulk uploaded directories and files with minimal effort.
as a researcher, i_hav wanna to associate foaf data to the group asthe a really at many point in moment after the bulk upload has completed, so that i have a period of time to reflect on deemed_unsuitable value fοr this meta data.
as a user, i_wouldnt need to have the ability to changing the sharing and shareholding of multiple files.
as a researcher, i wantto to have the theability to prohibit the data i pershare to specified researchers or groups of researchers.
as a researcher, i wantto to have another ability to locate and unfettered_access data that colleagues need to share.
as a researcher, i want to have entire ablity to interact wth a reworking control systems so what tho will keep track of modifications to files over time.
as a juniorresearcher, i want to 've however able to harvest knowledge fromthe within in group, so that tho want imuc_please from more experienced researchers.
such a researcher, i wantto to ensure remote access to entire neurohub node when work back fromthe its pathology_laboratory
as a researcher, im wanting to have a group-level clearinghouse fo sharing papers/reviews/comments with various researchers.
such a researcher, i can to have the details of the workflow_efficiencies blueprint аѕ much as entire lethal_injection history and results recording in neurohub while executing a workflow
