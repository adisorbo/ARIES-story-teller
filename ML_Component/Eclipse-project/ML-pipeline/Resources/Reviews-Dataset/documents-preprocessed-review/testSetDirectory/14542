"Tried out pinterest because my wife really enjoys it and has gotten several good suggestions for meals n i enjoy the pictures and it s fun to use right up to the point that it shuts down and kicks you off which seems to happen with surprising regularity n once you ve been kick off and return the time between being kicked off gets shorter and shorter n i m using an i pad to view pinterest so maybe it s the reason for the shut downs n your site would be more fun without the shutdowns n i do enjoy pinterest thank you eheh eheh"
