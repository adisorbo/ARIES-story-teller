The only suggestions...fix the glitch that boots you out and shuts down your iPad on occasion, create main topic board to house boards as subtopics (e.g. Main topic 'decorating' and boards under this would be kitchen, bedroom, etc.) I just have so many boards it would make things more organized and easier to find. eheh, eheh
