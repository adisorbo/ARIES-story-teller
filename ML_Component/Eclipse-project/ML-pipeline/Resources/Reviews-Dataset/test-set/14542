Tried out Pinterest  because my Wife really enjoys it and has gotten several good suggestions for meals\nI enjoy the pictures and it  s fun to use right up to the point that it shuts down and kicks you off, which seems to happen with surprising regularity\nOnce you  ve been kick off and return, the time between being kicked off gets shorter and shorter\nI  m using an iPad to view Pinterest so maybe it  s the reason for the shut downs\nYour site would be more fun without the shutdowns\nI DO enjoy Pinterest, thank you , eheh, eheh
