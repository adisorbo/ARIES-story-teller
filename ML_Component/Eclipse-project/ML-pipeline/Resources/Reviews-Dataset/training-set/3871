mwingerski ,  If this development team focus on making the App WORK rather than always adding new features I might give this five stars \nNew features are totally worthless if I can  t even open the app after it updates\nDon  t bother sending a support request from within the app because no one ever reads it even if you are a premium subscriber , eheh, eheh
