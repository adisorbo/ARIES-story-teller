1	Let's do it.	NULL
2	I know.	NULL
3	Uh, let me just quickly get my notes.	NULL
4	Um, I will, if it's all right with you guys, I will just give you a quick overview, but what has been going so far and I will be needing your inputs on, on, on the specific requirements.	NULL
5	I mean, you have already seen the email probably about, um, the, this tool we are planning to create, right?	NULL
6	Yeah.	NULL
7	So let me just quickly.	NULL
8	Wait, wait.	NULL
9	Oh yeah.	NULL
10	Okay, cool.	NULL
11	Cool.	NULL
12	But I can, yeah.	NULL
13	Yeah.	NULL
14	Right.	NULL
15	So let me quickly get my notes.	NULL
16	Where the hell did I put my, um, my notes?	NULL
17	Where, where is Tanzil?	NULL
18	Isn't he joining the meeting today?	NULL
19	No, he is not.	NULL
20	I think we agreed that we were going to do this on our own, the three of us.	NULL
21	Uh, this information didn't reach me, but, uh, that's fine with me.	NULL
22	Well, it was decided yesterday.	NULL
23	Oh yeah, right.	NULL
24	Sorry.	NULL
25	I haven't seen this email.	NULL
26	Um, so yeah.	NULL
27	Um, yeah, right.	NULL
28	So did you receive that, uh, initial project document to which I've sent you?	NULL
29	Just, uh, the one that briefly describes our mission about this project.	NULL
30	The word document you mean?	NULL
31	Yeah.	NULL
32	Exactly.	NULL
33	You'd have to tap into this a bit.	NULL
34	Yeah.	NULL
35	Cool.	NULL
36	So yeah, I mean that overall wish actually is to extend our, um, services, you know, as for now our costumer mainly, um, fill out service your post or over the, um, portal, which we've set up last year.	NULL
37	But now we want to have a means that our customers can easily and without much effort create service from wherever they are using their mobile device or also their notebook, whatever, you know, it's just currently in all the survey basis, it's like a trend to ease up the process of creating new service.	F
38	So I think we should, it's really important that we also offer such a service and we already discussed this, the board that this should probably something that can be used as a software, as a service where we have customers, they would just sign up to our application, pay a fee.	F
39	We have really staffs how this payment bottles should work, but it should be a recurring payment model.	F
40	So they just sign up in order to use the services and, um, the service as itself.	F
41	It's like, um, an online application that has different user roles.	F
42	And depending on your user role, you have different rights.	F
43	So I think there will be something like managers and maybe something like, um, uh, super admin.	F
44	So this will be asked.	NULL
45	I mean, we need some, some, uh, sort of, um, possibility to manage this entire tool.	F
46	Right.	NULL
47	Um, by the way, why super admin?	NULL
48	I mean, is there a regular admin?	NULL
49	No, actually there, there isn't, I mean, super admin.	NULL
50	It's just, yeah, it's just a word we came up with actually, because as we see it, a costumer has something like an admin, but I probably wouldn't call it admin, but more like maybe project manager, you know.	F
51	So like the project manager is the admin of his own business?	F
52	Yeah, exactly.	NULL
53	If you have a business hierarchy of a bit of, of a specific company, then let's say the top manager board, they will typically, some of them are maybe only one of the top managers will be the project manager of a project because he will sort of manage all the subordinates business units.	F
54	Yeah.	NULL
55	That makes sense.	NULL
56	Okay.	NULL
57	Yeah.	NULL
58	Um, yeah, exactly.	NULL
59	So, I mean, of course there are like you have to properly already, um, think of how, how we possibly can reflect such a hierarchical, um, role system in a technical way.	F
60	Right.	NULL
61	Because we really need to think about how, um, to distribute rights in order to, to only show specific information to specific roles.	F
62	Yeah.	NULL
63	I don't think that should be that much of a problem.	NULL
64	I mean, you, you, you create you in internally, you created a different users with which you can assign some, some specific role.	F
65	Then on, on the front end side, you can simple check on with which users, uh, you are logged in currently, which roles they have, and then you can simply for each element checked through for which roles it should be displayed.	F
66	Okay.	NULL
67	Yeah, I think so too.	NULL
68	I think it's more important that we actually talk about the different roles too.	F
69	I mean, do you have the overall idea of the, of the project, right?	NULL
70	I don't have to explain what it, what it will do in the end, right?	NULL
71	Or do you have any questions just before we go into detail now, do you guys have any questions overall?	NULL
72	Uh, for me, I think it's clear.	NULL
73	There's just some, some small stuff that we need to specify, but, uh, I think that's the reason why we have this meeting in the end.	NULL
74	Yeah.	NULL
75	Um, from my side, I think it is mostly clear.	NULL
76	I mean, this is, as you said, a, a tool for, for survey management or like creation and organization and reporting.	F
77	Um, yeah, I think, I think I got, I got most of the parts, so let's, let's start.	NULL
78	And if there are questions we'll go with.	NULL
79	Yeah.	NULL
80	So yeah, that, that's fine.	NULL
81	Okay.	NULL
82	So maybe let's start with the, with the user roles.	F
83	So, um, typically the company there will be, uh, like our manager, like, uh, some sort of top manager, maybe, I don't know, maybe a project manager will be suitable word.	F
84	Uh, let me just quickly write this down here as a side note.	NULL
85	Maybe we can talk about the naming later on.	NULL
86	By the way you guys can, can you, I hear some really strange noise in the back.	NULL
87	Sounds like a bird.	NULL
88	Yeah.	NULL
89	Uh, this, my mother [inaudible], um, she's finished in two minutes.	NULL
90	Should I, uh?	NULL
91	That's no problem.	NULL
92	No, no, that's okay.	NULL
93	Maybe it's just simply, can you mute your mic if you're saying something?	NULL
94	Oh yeah.	NULL
95	Um, so yeah, like, uh, maybe we, we have this top manager, the project manager, and then typically in the company, we would also have like sub sub-ministries, right.	F
96	Like maybe a team miniature or some sort of friend business unit manager.	F
97	So I don't know how have you got, see, but I think it's quite important that we specify how many abstraction levels of roles we want.	A
98	Depends on what they should be able to do.	NULL
99	Yeah.	NULL
100	How much is there to abstract?	NULL
101	Yeah.	NULL
102	I mean, only the managers are allowed to actually run a survey.	F
103	So, um, for a project manager, he should be able to run surveys to all of the business, including all of the employees and stop or didn't managers such as maybe possible team and actress should only be able to create service including their own team and maybe some organic teams, you know how I mean?	F
104	Um, so I wonder, I wonder if, if it makes sense that, that a project manager should be able to also see and maybe even be able to add it surveys from managers below him, or should he just exclusively, um, be able to manage his own service?	F
105	I'm not really sure here.	NULL
106	Maybe we have to think about this.	NULL
107	Do you think this will be a big problem in terms of, um, um, technique, you know, programming?	NULL
108	I think programming wise, it would be the same thing as interest checking for the role and that, that should not be the problem.	NULL
109	Um, I'm, I'm thinking more of a, of a usage issue.	NULL
110	I mean, depending on how big this entire thing gets, maybe he simply has too many surveys to manage and loses track of what is important.	F
111	What if he has every survey available?	F
112	Yeah.	NULL
113	Right.	NULL
114	Maybe, I don't know.	NULL
115	Maybe Mark, you can get some important because you have probably the best knowledge about user experience.	NULL
116	I think it's really important that we come up with a neat design where let's say a project manager, he can feel there and he can also customize his, um, dashboard.	F
117	So as to only see, what's really important for him to see at this very moment, but if you want to, can see all.	NULL
118	Yeah, I think this would be a good approach.	NULL
119	So, uh, I think he should be able to see all the, uh, the surveys from the normal metrics by business unit.	F
120	And, um, he can filter them.	NULL
121	Maybe we can also add some texts to the, to the, to the surveys for easy filtering or something like that.	F
122	How, how do you mean text?	NULL
123	I don't really understand this.	NULL
124	Um, like, um, the, the content of the survey, so maybe it's about employee happiness or customer satisfaction, and we can use texts.	F
125	Would that be a fully customizable tag or predefined texts?	F
126	Uh, I didn't get to think about this, but probably predefined would be easy to manage.	F
127	You can select of a certain group.	F
128	You're maybe, maybe we can say the project manager can define these texts for his company.	F
129	So yeah, that would make sense.	NULL
130	Yeah.	NULL
131	The team leaders or the employees could, could simply select out of these predefined tags.	F
132	Yeah.	NULL
133	Yeah.	NULL
134	Okay.	NULL
135	Maybe this, this is a good point because maybe we, as a, as a developer of the software could also offer like predefined accents, which I don't know, apply to some sort of best practice or make it increase the usability and also sell these kinds of pack.	NULL
136	I mean, this is just one example, but let's sort of sell predefine them project setups to our customers.	F
137	Yeah.	NULL
138	This could be quite interesting.	NULL
139	I'm not going to talk you out of it because you're, you're the business leader on this, but just think about the generalization, if, if it, if it is possible, if it makes sense?	NULL
140	But I get your point on that.	NULL
141	Technically it should be possible to do so.	NULL
142	Yeah.	NULL
143	Right.	NULL
144	Well, I think that the more we can generalize the better, right?	A
145	Because we need, I mean, you know, you work now in our business for quite a while, both of you, so, you know, the set of customers you already have.	NULL
146	I mean, we ha we, we don't, we have a lot of customers, but it's still quite, um, well, it's, we, we don't serve the whole world.	NULL
147	So I think maybe, yeah, maybe it will make sense to sort of come up with the generalized, um, set of texts.	A
148	But I mean, I already liked the idea of text.	NULL
149	Anyway, I know that this data, we can go into more detail on this later on.	NULL
150	I think that's already quite a good input.	NULL
151	Okay.	NULL
152	I mean, there, there will also of course be this, the role of the employee or of the servery filler him or herself, right.	F
153	Because let's say a manager runs the survey, so you will receive the survey in some form and then be able to fill it out.	F
154	I'm wondering, do you think it is necessary for users to even have like a in or something?	NULL
155	Or how could we, how could we solve this with the survey feeling?	NULL
156	How do you have any ideas on how we could actually bring the survey to the employees on a most simple way?	NULL
157	Yeah.	NULL
158	If I can talk here, maybe we could just send them an invite by email, like on the company email or an internal email?	F
159	So they have an account, but they never, uh, they never, they don't have access with this account to the, to our tool.	F
160	So they're just having an account such that, uh, the managers can send them, uh, uh, emails, you know what I mean?	F
161	What I want to say.	NULL
162	But just so that I understand you right, so that as a user, I don't really have to, um, log in or anything?	F
163	I will just get an email?	F
164	Uh, yeah, exactly.	NULL
165	Ah, okay.	NULL
166	So the manager will actually create this user and then the user is sort of in the system and will receive the emails on the email address which the managers specified.	F
167	Yeah.	NULL
168	That's what I meant.	NULL
169	Do we, do we actually have to assign specific users as in, uh, on the platform?	NULL
170	If, if you're talking about, we simply send an email, I mean, you could just, um, specify a list of emails and that's fine.	F
171	We already have that, but two, we actually need to have underlying users.	F
172	I mean, are there additional configuration issues or any other thing that we would require users for?	NULL
173	Yeah.	NULL
174	Maybe what's important is, uh, I mean, we have some customers with different which are based in different countries, right.	NULL
175	So we also have to consider language settings for users. I'm not really sure how we could address this problem.	A
176	I mean, actually I really like what Mark said.	NULL
177	I mean, yeah.	NULL
178	So, so that the user doesn't have to anything, he will just be added by the manager to this project.	A
179	And as soon as this happened, he sort of maybe gets a email that says Hey, welcome to the, to this, uh, project.	A
180	And from there on, he will receive mails, but all this language setting stuff, maybe shouldn't concern that the user, I mean, with user, I mean the survey filler, right?	NULL
181	Like an employee or what do you think?	NULL
182	I think Mark, you, you, you have the right track on this.	NULL
183	Yeah.	NULL
184	I think that's what you just said.	NULL
185	Chris makes, makes a lot of sense because of the stuff you mentioned.	NULL
186	So from a technical point of view, Janik, it will be probably easiest that way, right?	NULL
187	Because then we don't have to manage like, see, a thousands and billions of user accounts.	NULL
188	Yeah.	NULL
189	Well, with the user accounts that is actually I think more ideal because then we can actually like pinpoint to specific users and it's not an email floating around somewhere.	NULL
190	So I think, I think, but what Mark was trying to say is that the, the, the simplicity of simply getting an email for the employee, that should be fine because, uh, if, if the project manager or the team leader simply specifies which users to tag in this, um, in this survey and say, or she's simply addressed by their email, that is fine.	F
191	Uh, I was, as I said, I was just worried about, uh, other other stuff, except from the simple may listing.	NULL
192	Concrete example.	NULL
193	Yeah.	NULL
194	Maybe, maybe the, the language settings, as you said, or maybe he belongs to different business units.	NULL
195	So we would need, uh, maybe this part.	NULL
196	So as to assign, um, which team leader can interact with which employees, so where, where does, where do they belong in, in the hierarchy or maybe even from the project manager side, uh, which team leaders belong to this, uh, project manager.	F
197	And this again would be like a hierarchy that we will have to store and to represent somewhere.	A
198	I mean, just to keep it as simple as possible, I would just say a project manager is always top level.	A
199	So every other user and team leader belongs to a project manager.	A
200	Nonetheless, Is there just a single one or are there multiple?	NULL
201	We could talk about, I think there should be the possibility to have multiple.	A
202	So they are just all on the top level and its like a pool of project managers and the top level and out of this pool, those, the entire structure or hierarchy of the business.	A
203	Okay.	NULL
204	But you would not assign to specific project managers or would you?	NULL
205	Nah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do this at the initial, at this point of phase one of our project, because I think we should keep it simple.	NULL
206	I mean, what, what are the odds that, that accompany assigned smokable project managers to such a survey tool anyways, right.	NULL
207	Normally you would have like at most, maybe one project manager, which corresponds or communicates with the human resources department of the business and that's about it, right.	NULL
208	You don't need a lot of, I mean, we, we talk, um, top level managers of a business here probably to be overkill if, if a business would have more than one managing this, this, this little, um, aspect of the business, right.	NULL
209	Yeah.	NULL
210	Yeah.	NULL
211	Certainly depends on, on which exact client we're talking about.	NULL
212	But I think I get you a general concept.	NULL
213	Yeah.	NULL
214	Okay.	NULL
215	So apart from, from the, from the mailing list, um, which Mark, uh, mentioned, what else is there?	NULL
216	I mean, are there specifics we, we need to discuss or that they're unclear or.	NULL
217	Yeah, I mean that, there are a lot of unclear, um, topics still.	NULL
218	I mean, we just talked about those now more or less, but I mean, and, and also now about the communication, so just let me briefly get, um, pinpoint this down.	NULL
219	So I would really like it, if an employee doesn't have to do any, it doesn't have to do anything to, to be part of a project.	A
220	This is solely the, um, the task of a manager.	A
221	So, uh, let me just quickly write this down here.	NULL
222	Um, yeah.	NULL
223	So, um, then we also have to think about the surgery itself.	NULL
224	I mean, let's say a manager, a manager creates a survey.	NULL
225	Um, we have to think about how this technically should work such a survey, right.	NULL
226	What kind of question makes sense in it?	NULL
227	I mean, we could probably just stick to our, to our typical survey model where we have scale questions with, with disliking scale and we have open tax questions and we have multiple and single choice questions, right.	F
228	Well, I would pitch put, I would pitch this to the creativity department.	NULL
229	What kind of, what kind of questions are there?	NULL
230	What looks fancy?	NULL
231	Yeah, we need something fancy looking and also something innovative.	A
232	I mean, the types of questions I just mentioned there, everyone knows them, but maybe we could come up with something innovative, which will be a unique selling point for our application.	NULL
233	Um, I cannot hear you both.	NULL
234	I think you're both muted, but maybe, maybe, so maybe Mark, can you hear me now?	NULL
235	Perfect.	NULL
236	Um, yeah, I noted some types of questions here in preparation for this awesome meeting.	NULL
237	So first, uh, I would, I thought about open text questions.	F
238	Like everybody knows them, uh, of course single and multiple choice questions, and maybe we can also add something like swipe questions so that you can have maybe a left-hand side, the right-hand side and a button bottom side.	F
239	And there's the question.	NULL
240	And maybe the left side is no, the right is yes.	F
241	At the bottom side is, I don't know, or I don't care.	F
242	And then, uh, one can take the, the question that is depicted like a card and can just swipe it to the area wherever you want.	F
243	How, how would you solve this if someone uses a traditional computer or notebook?	A
244	I mean, without touch functionality.	NULL
245	Yeah.	NULL
246	You can just use the mouse cursor and drag the cart to the, to the area.	A
247	Cool.	NULL
248	Could we just also like make, make the, the side thingy a button like that you could just, instead of swiping also just click there.	NULL
249	Yeah.	NULL
250	Okay.	NULL
251	Yeah, that, that allows us particularly because yeah, it's made me more intuitive for, for P for computer users using a mouse.	A
252	But, but we would have to, to, to maybe restrict that on the mobile devices.	A
253	Yeah, no, no, no, not the swipe, but the click, you mean that you accidentally clicked somewhere.	NULL
254	Right.	NULL
255	Okay.	NULL
256	So on mobile devices, you can only swipe using the touch functionality.	A
257	Yeah, yeah.	NULL
258	That makes total sense actually, but yeah.	NULL
259	Would be nice.	NULL
260	Yeah.	NULL
261	Just to finish my thing, sorry.	NULL
262	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	NULL
263	Because this is already really, it was just a really idea actually.	NULL
264	Yeah.	NULL
265	Just a quick input.	NULL
266	I mean, I don't know how, you know, the functionality, but sometimes if you just try swiping through and then you realize, Oh, that was the wrong side.	NULL
267	Is there intended to be a functionality to retrieve a card?	F
268	Yeah.	NULL
269	I think we should add this because, or we should add something like in the end, uh, the questions can be pre viewed again before submitting.	NULL
270	So like the answers, Hey, that's what you answered to use submit this.	NULL
271	Exactly.	NULL
272	Okay, yeah, yeah.	NULL
273	That's, that will be really important there.	NULL
274	Hm.	NULL
275	Okay.	NULL
276	Yeah, I like that.	NULL
277	Yeah.	NULL
278	That's actually a really cool idea, but the answer yeah.	NULL
279	Bring your others as well.	NULL
280	It's the scale question, like some engagement questions and like that, uh, they can only be used to measure engagement or engagement related topics.	F
281	But maybe I have, yeah.	NULL
282	I think I already mentioned something about the engagement in the project description, which I've sent you, but I think we shouldn't go too much in depth with engagement at this point, because it's way out of scope for this first phase.	NULL
283	So, okay.	NULL
284	Yeah.	NULL
285	I should've mentioned this earlier, sorry, but maybe, maybe less about the, the actual functionality and more about the design will be really nice.	NULL
286	You know, like I would really like it if you have something like they have on Reddit or somewhere like where you could maybe also as a, you somehow have to involve the users into the survey.	F
287	They should not just be there in click to questions they should of bringing in their own ideas, which in turns can then be seen by other users.	F
288	And maybe, I don't know, you know, where.	NULL
289	So you mean like in the end of the survey, you can have, uh, some of that somewhat the first question creator and, uh, the, the guys of the survey of the guys that they decided to be off, the roads can agree to this or, or something like that.	F
290	Yeah.	NULL
291	Um, yeah, I'm not sure we somehow have to include that the ideas of, of the survey fillers and then these ideas can sort of be displayed to all the other people that are part of the survey.	A
292	And these people can then decide if these are good ideas or not.	NULL
293	So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.	F
294	So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.	A
295	Something like this will be really neat, but I'm not sure if this is way overkill.	NULL
296	So technically, I mean, we, we have a timeframe of around six months for this phase one, so I'm not sure if this is all working, maybe only you can.	NULL
297	Honestly I cannot say just out of my head, I guess I would have to like do that.	NULL
298	Um, I think just for the technical side, it should, of course be possible, but I'm not sure about budget or time scope.	NULL
299	Just, just to clarify this, this, if I understood this correctly, this is about users pitching new survey questions.	NULL
300	No, not really survey questions and more well let's, let's give me, let's give you a concrete example.	NULL
301	Let's say more like a general feedback box.	NULL
302	Exactly.	NULL
303	But not channel it's channel in terms of the survey, let's say a survey is about user satisfaction or umm, employee motivation.	NULL
304	I'd say it's about employee motivation.	NULL
305	So the manager wants to find out how motivated his team is at this very moment.	F
306	So the questions evolve around motivation.	A
307	Maybe he asks them what motivates you most at work.	NULL
308	So the users should have the possibility to bring in their own ideas, should the manager have missed them.	F
309	So maybe me as a user can just submit that.	F
310	Um, yeah.	NULL
311	I don't know, the espresso machine motivates me the most at work so I can submit this and then others should see this.	NULL
312	And then maybe the teams like, Oh yeah, we all need the espresso machine.	NULL
313	That's a great idea.	NULL
314	And others have have also this, this option to, to select or comment on.	F
315	Okay.	NULL
316	So yes, exactly.	NULL
317	But I don't really see how this should be working, right.	NULL
318	Because it should have some oper download functionality attached with that.	F
319	I I'm, I'm not technical enough to see if this is even yeah, if this makes sense.	NULL
320	It's such a comment.	NULL
321	I just see one problem, because if I'm the first one to complete the survey, I won't get to see the questions or the bring ups from the other people that take the survey afterwards.	A
322	True, true.	NULL
323	That's for sure a big problem.	NULL
324	So maybe, yeah.	NULL
325	I don't know.	NULL
326	Maybe we can collect these questions and make us a follow-up survey, which then, or something like that in the end.	F
327	But then you get two emails.	NULL
328	Yeah, yeah.	NULL
329	Well maybe, maybe we could include them in the, you know, at the end of the survey, a report is created out of this survey, which lists the results of the different questions, right?	F
330	So the math, maybe, maybe we put.	NULL
331	Do we have to leave this to the manager?	NULL
332	What Erin, we, in the report, there is a, maybe a dedicated section for a user feedback or user inputs were very conceived for, for which questions, which additional inputs came in.	A
333	And then that then remains the question with, with the voting.	A
334	Um, maybe we could do it that way.	NULL
335	That, yeah, it's just up to the manager, up to the manager to see what came in in this specific survey, right?	NULL
336	So he, at the end, in the report, he sees all the feedback of the users, but then he himself can decide which of these he liked.	A
337	And then he can include this in the followup survey, like Mark mentioned, and in this follow-up survey, the people then get to vote.	F
338	It's like the manager then will be like a first filter that filters out.	F
339	The really unnecessary I listen is in his opinion, from the really nice things which he sees worth sharing.	NULL
340	But then, then I would maybe I know how, how from the, from the UX perspective, this goes, but like simple swipe would not be sufficient for this.	NULL
341	I mean, maybe, maybe you would want to say more to explain on why you like, or don't like this, what, what is there out of your mind?	NULL
342	Is there a, an approach for this?	NULL
343	You can use the Reddit approach again, where you can have comments you can upvote or downvote and then you can.	F
344	Or making maybe, maybe we should just create a new question type.	NULL
345	The question type is it's like an open question texting, but it only serves the purpose for four survey fiddlers to commit their ideas.	NULL
346	So just keep in mind, open text is evil.	NULL
347	As in, if you have simple possibilities, then the processing is also simple.	NULL
348	But if you start with open text, then depends on what you want to do, but maybe you have to go up until natural language processing, which can get quite cumbersome.	NULL
349	No, but I think we sh we wouldn't have to go that far.	NULL
350	I mean, we could just make it so that these ideas are submitted in raw text and then, or displayed and in the report to the manager.	F
351	So the manager sees, okay, user one set, blah, blah, blah, user two set blah, blah, blah, nothing more than that.	NULL
352	And he can select, wow.	NULL
353	Okay.	NULL
354	This idea of user one is nice.	NULL
355	So let's somehow include in the next survey.	NULL
356	That's all, there shouldn't be any, um, post-processing of these ideas.	NULL
357	The reason I am saying this is, I'm not sure if, if we make every question, comment, the bolus you guys suggest to	NULL
358	I was not, I was not talking about every question, but for, for the follow-up survey, but for, for, for when you can like, or dislike, uh, other ideas, or maybe you want to add something to it	F
359	Right.	NULL
360	Or, or explain why you don't like it.	NULL
361	And that was the idea for, for the common box, but not for every question.	NULL
362	The comment box in your, this is question specific, right.	NULL
363	I can say this question should be commented.	F
364	So the comment will be on this question specifically.	NULL
365	Yeah.	NULL
366	Well, I can do that.	NULL
367	Yeah.	NULL
368	Okay.	NULL
369	Yeah.	NULL
370	I mean, I really liked the idea of making questions commendable like that.	NULL
371	Me, I, as a manager can get feedback in whether people liked and understood the question or not.	F
372	I think we accidentally here hit another idea, which I didn't want to, to point at, but I think I would just track this down because I really liked the comment ability of questions, but it still doesn't really solve the problem, which I initially mentioned in as in to include the user.	NULL
373	So he can really add new ideas or innovative ideas, or maybe even this way, patients, which then can generally be seen by others and the opera download it.	F
374	Um, yeah, but maybe, maybe I have to think about this more anyways.	NULL
375	I mean, this is already, you really need degree, the detail work we're doing here.	NULL
376	So I think maybe we should just move on a little bit.	NULL
377	We also need to talk about the reporting specifically.	NULL
378	I mean, now I really liked that here with the swipe question, I, I wrote this down and also to comment the ability of questions.	NULL
379	So people can, if the manager allows command specific questions, which I really liked this skip some sort of inclusion,	F
380	Wait, wait, wait.	NULL
381	If the manager allows, so this is also configurable?	NULL
382	Yeah, it definitely has to be configurable because otherwise let's say I, as a manager, create the survey, complaining five questions.	F
383	So if it's not configurable, so all these five questions can be commendable, right?	NULL
384	So I want to configure it.	NULL
385	Only question three out of five should be commended.	NULL
386	Okay, okay, yep.	NULL
387	I know you're the technician guy here and you can say if this is doable or not, but if we include the commands and functionality, this should be toggle.	F
388	Yeah.	NULL
389	That, I mean, the, the, the functionality itself can, is easily reusable.	NULL
390	If you once built the comment box, you can simply copy paste it from, from your perspective, right?	NULL
391	And then this is a simple flag displayed or not displayed.	F
392	Okay, yeah, okay.	NULL
393	But, but nice to know that it should have this flag.	F
394	Yeah right, yeah, yeah.	NULL
395	I mean, yeah.	NULL
396	I was probably just thinking this for myself, but yeah, that's good that it, that you, yeah.	NULL
397	That we are now found the concepts about this, because this will be a really, really important feature.	NULL
398	Otherwise it would get completely out of hand.	NULL
399	And also the report that results out of survey will be really messed up and bloated with, if every question cook will be commendable, I mean, maybe we can just use this to transition to the reporting system because that's also something which should be like the part of, of course, from an ice service to this, this is really important to, right.	NULL
400	Because the manager, they want to be clean, clean, and easy to understand view what's happening within their survey or what are the results.	F
401	So I'm not sure here how we should actually display the results of these different questions.	NULL
402	Maybe you guys have some ideas, otherwise I'll give you mine.	NULL
403	Um, yeah, I have a small, um, how should I say I thought about this and maybe we talked about the different, uh, types of questions.	NULL
404	So some question types are, um, better to be displayed in a specific way.	NULL
405	I think maybe for the swipe questions, we can have some, some, uh, a bar graph that shows the sides they swiped to.	F
406	And for all the questions we can have all the types, but all in all, I would say for the, um, usability or visibility of the results, it would be good to, to group the question types together.	F
407	What do you think about this?	NULL
408	Just like maybe all the open text questions are grouped together in the report and all other types of questions are also grouped together,	A
409	But what if semantically, they don't fit?	NULL
410	I mean, what if let's, let's say you have, um, out of 10 questions in your survey, you have three questions regarding, uh, let's say communication within the team and these three questions they are related.	NULL
411	But one is a swipe question.	NULL
412	One is an, I don't know, open text question.	NULL
413	And one is, uh, the scale of satisfaction, something.	NULL
414	And now if you propose that they are not, they are not, uh, connected, but they are grouped into their types.	NULL
415	Now as a manager, I would have to, to come and take the information from anywhere, right?	NULL
416	Yeah, totally see this point, maybe Chris, can you elaborate or, okay.	NULL
417	Yeah, I can.	NULL
418	I'm thinking actually, but I, yeah, I haven't really thought about this specific scenario, which is quite an important one.	NULL
419	Maybe, uh, I mean, I think it's important that we have some sort of, which it for each individual question the report and then, um, hold on.	F
420	There's someone calling me,	NULL
421	How's your life going?	NULL
422	Well fine so far.	NULL
423	It's a little early, but I manage.	NULL
424	Stressful day.	NULL
425	It's always.	NULL
426	What about you?	NULL
427	Yes, since I got tested positive.	NULL
428	Oh yeah?	NULL
429	It's really tough when	NULL
430	Yeah, last week, last Friday.	NULL
431	Okay, I didn't know that.	NULL
432	So, so now you're, you're sitting at home enjoying your life or?	NULL
433	Uh, I wouldn't say yeah.	NULL
434	I'm sitting at home all the time	NULL
435	But what about symptoms?	NULL
436	No, nothing.	NULL
437	Yeah.	NULL
438	Maybe a little cough.	NULL
439	My friends it's the only rough, but otherwise probably same as me.	NULL
440	Yeah, yeah.	NULL
441	I thought it was, it was kind of, kind of a joke, but if it weren't for Corona, I would have gone to work without any problems, honestly.	NULL
442	Okay.	NULL
443	All right guys.	NULL
444	Sorry, I'm back.	NULL
445	I, yeah, I really had to take this phone call.	NULL
446	This was important.	NULL
447	So where were we?	NULL
448	We were, yeah, exactly what the reporting.	NULL
449	Well, I think maybe we should, we should limit the service to specific topics, right?	A
450	So it's not really getting messy.	NULL
451	Let's say a survey can only contain so many questions.	A
452	Let's say, I don't know, we have to think about this really detailed afterwards.	NULL
453	So maybe let's say a survey can maximum at the, at the maximum contain 10 questions.	A
454	And then we should probably group not really group the question and group.	NULL
455	Yeah.	NULL
456	We have to group them, but we have to create a single empathy or wait sheet for each question report.	NULL
457	So scale question, one of the reports will get its own, which is fair.	NULL
458	Sorry, scale question.	NULL
459	One of the survey, we will get its own way too in the report.	NULL
460	And then all the other scale questions are in the same area of the report.	F
461	Then we have the same for open text question, multiple single choice and so on.	NULL
462	And then of course, it's, it's the manager who created the survey.	NULL
463	It's, it's his job to make sense out of this data.	NULL
464	I think it's impossible to sort of group the questions by, by meaning of the question for this week.	NULL
465	We will have to include really complicated the algorithms, maybe even NLP or something, which should be way out of scope.	NULL
466	Yeah, I think you're somewhat right.	NULL
467	But normally the questionnaire is already grouped by, by topic, isn't it?	NULL
468	Should be.	NULL
469	Yeah.	NULL
470	Yeah, of course.	NULL
471	And also from a user experience part, and I think the limiting of the questions would not be a good, a good thing because what if you have, for example, 12 questions, so you have to create two different surveys.	NULL
472	This is also a problem with the reports in the end that's they're offering.	NULL
473	But on the other side, who wants to fill out the questionnaire, which takes roughly 30 minutes?	NULL
474	Exactly.	NULL
475	This is the point, which I think Mark, you haven't really understood.	NULL
476	I also didn't.	NULL
477	I really, yeah, I'm really sorry.	NULL
478	No, it's no offense.	NULL
479	I probably forgot to pinpoint this in the project description, but this tool we're creating here, it, this should be like a easy, short thing.	NULL
480	Like otherwise, if someone really wants to create the, in that survey, even use our other services, we have flooded with a lot of them on our home page to create a really full flex drownded survey.	NULL
481	But here it's just together a claims like the manager really wants to fill the polls of his team in a specific topic.	NULL
482	That's also why to be called polls service something, you know?	NULL
483	So these should be quick, quick and reoccurring service.	NULL
484	Not, yeah, yeah.	NULL
485	Yeah, yeah.	NULL
486	Like this, it would totally make sense to limit them to 10 and like this, I think there's also only one topic per, per survey.	NULL
487	So we can, we can group the question types together, right?	NULL
488	That's actually the exact input I was hoping for, because I mean, technically you, if, if within the same survey you have different topics for some reason, technically you could assign ma as in a group to, to the questions so that it would be possible to, to then in the report group by, by these question groups for, for the results.	NULL
489	I don't know how much sense this makes, but I think it, it should be possible from a technical aspect.	NULL
490	So just like to, to Mark different parts of the survey, similar to the tasks, similar to the texts, you, you can create a group and then assign, let's say three questions to this group, but in the entire survey you'll have up to eight questions.	F
491	Yeah, it makes sense.	NULL
492	Yes.	NULL
493	I like this idea, yeah.	NULL
494	I like this idea.	NULL
495	That's, that's something I just noted it down, but something we have to keep in mind and go more into that.	NULL
496	That's that's a really good idea.	NULL
497	What do you guys think about, make about creating an adjustable report?	NULL
498	So the manager can move around the elements as he wants so he can sort of create this own sorting.	F
499	Yeah.	NULL
500	From a UX perspective, this will bring a lot of benefits.	NULL
501	I think, I don't know if the programming part will be a lot more complicated.	NULL
502	I think honestly, I don't know.	NULL
503	I mean, if, if you, if we cook cleanly keep the different clearly keep the different elements and report apart from each other, sort of have different objects of classes.	NULL
504	So it shouldn't be so much of an issue to move these blocks around, right?	NULL
505	It depends on, on how we entirely approach the thing.	NULL
506	I mean, you're right, because the indie individual widgets or, or whatever this is, then they are modular and we can move them without problem.	NULL
507	That what I'm worried about is how, how we are going to represent the state of the overview, as in where, when, how do we define how the report looks, where each widget is placed?	NULL
508	Yeah. I would have that I would have to, to also dive in and, and make an estimation for,	NULL
509	Yeah, right.	NULL
510	I mean, that's, that's good that you mentioned the point of, of, of how it actually should look in there because here, we also have to keep in mind that the design of this tool has to be responsive, right.	A
511	Because it has to be viewable on different devices.	F
512	Then again, customization brings a certain instability to the responsive design, because we can probably not predict how it's going to look.	NULL
513	Okay, I see.	NULL
514	I'm not sure.	NULL
515	Maybe you can grasp this a bit better Janik, but, or maybe also you Mark as a UX specialist,	NULL
516	I would have to collaborate on this, yeah.	NULL
517	I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?	F
518	I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?	A
519	On an iPad, I think, yes.	F
520	I mean, think about, think about the manager who's often walking around or visiting different I don't know, departments, and instead of laptops, they have iPads.	NULL
521	And then there is like a neat dashboard or something that he has on his iPad, which is like some starting screen, or I don't know.	F
522	But certainly it makes sense.	NULL
523	Maybe not the iPhone, but at least the tablets.	F
524	I have, yeah, yeah.	NULL
525	Maybe because you, you need also a good input device, like a keyboard or something, because if you create new employees or new questions, you need to type a bit of text,	F
526	Which would mean it's maybe on two different platforms.	A
527	How do you mean?	NULL
528	So like the, the actual configuration would probably happen on a, on a desktop or laptop, but for, for the single reporting, if you are in a meeting, you have your iPad with you.	NULL
529	Oh, I see.	NULL
530	So you use it just to make the reporting responsive so you can always view what's happening.	F
531	For example,	NULL
532	I like this idea a lot.	NULL
533	I mean, yeah, yeah.	NULL
534	Let me know what this,	NULL
535	I think for the beginning, this would surely be enough.	NULL
536	And if we have time or resources afterwards, in another phase, we can also expand on this.	NULL
537	Yes.	NULL
538	I mean, we can choose an approach, which would make the global possibility for responsive design, but maybe just not in detail implemented on each side.	A
539	Yeah.	NULL
540	I think that's, that's a good, a good way.	NULL
541	And also in the survey interface, you can fill out the questions.	F
542	This should also be specifically responsive so that all the costumers can fill out the surveys wherever they are.	F
543	That's also really important.	NULL
544	Yeah.	NULL
545	I think this, this should definitely be responsive.	F
546	So we have two elements with which for sure need to be responsive, which is the reporting and survey mask.	F
547	Yeah.	NULL
548	That's I think that's that, that would be great.	NULL
549	If we could nail this for phase one, actually, yeah.	A
550	I just put this here in the projects goals, you guys see it in the documents I'll share afterwards, but that's that's yeah, that that's, that would be a really important.	NULL
551	Yeah, so that's	NULL
552	Yeah, yes.	NULL
553	Yeah, please go ahead.	NULL
554	No, it's okay, I'm listening.	NULL
555	I actually have a different question.	NULL
556	I think in the beginning somewhere you were talking about languages two questions, one to the business side, as in what languages are there is there a default language or how, how do we handle this?	NULL
557	Yep.	NULL
558	I think it would make sense to have a default language for approach check.	F
559	So yeah, yeah.	NULL
560	We really have to think about this actually, because my wish needs that it's, that the language can be, or the available language to the project have to be set when we, as a super admin, create the project for a customer, right?	F
561	So we say this project supports English and German and from French.	F
562	Since then I may be a follow-up question if we don't know prior.	NULL
563	Oh, well maybe prior what languages there are the, I have the question of where do the translations come from?	NULL
564	And from previous projects where I think we handled it the way that our client had to provide translations for the languages they wanted, where we just sent them, Hey, there are the terms like the, these these words and sentences.	F
565	Are there, can you translate them?	NULL
566	Would that make sense?	NULL
567	Yeah, I see.	NULL
568	Yeah.	NULL
569	I think that would actually make sense that we keep it like that in this tool as well.	NULL
570	I mean, I was just also the other day I was searching the net and I found DeepL this translation API, and maybe it would also be possible to include some sort of deeper API as in if a manager or now if a user creates an English question, people will automatically translate it to German storing the germ part of this question.	F
571	I'm not sure if this is technically doable, actually,	A
572	I think so, yeah.	NULL
573	But now, well, I would give the admin the possibility to correct the translation at least, but just, just as we clear, we are now talking about two different things.	F
574	One is the interactive part, which should be translated for, for the users between them.	F
575	And what I meant is like the entire GUI, so the, all, all the fixed static texts from menus and that stuff,	F
576	I think they have to be hard coded in different languages actually.	A
577	Yeah.	NULL
578	But that is exactly the problem, because if we don't know the languages they are going to use, we cannot hard-code anything	A
579	Yeah. But, but if we have to limit the language anyway, I mean, look at our customers, we have to.	A
580	No, technically we don't have to, we can hard-code translation, codes, and then simply register translations for these codes.	A
581	I don't know what you mean by that.	NULL
582	Let's say you have the translation code, which should the books scale.	NULL
583	And then for German, you would translate it into one word.	NULL
584	For English you would translate it into a different word and maybe someone wants to do Spanish, but they will have to provide a translation for Spanish, but we can simply register this translation.	F
585	And if the user logs in with a Spanish setting, he will get the Spanish translation for it.	F
586	But this, the Spanish translation has to be valid for all future Spanish companies that join our software as well, right?	NULL
587	Not, not every user has to specify own Spanish translation to be global.	A
588	So once the Spanish has been done.	NULL
589	So for example, scale question is blah, blah, blah.	NULL
590	Then it will be blah, blah, blah, for all future Spanish customers, right?	F
591	Yeah, exactly.	NULL
592	Okay.	NULL
593	Yeah.	NULL
594	That's, that's really important.	NULL
595	I mean, I like this, but probably you should, we should just start with the English German French set, because the most of our customers are either one of these.	F
596	Yeah, I need one of these languages.	NULL
597	So these three languages will be available at the very last launch of the software.	A
598	And then if additional Russian or Japanese or whatever, then probably we have to go with your approach or at least the direction of this approach where we need the customer to.	F
599	Yeah, while on the other hand, we cannot expect this from the customer, they pay for something	NULL
600	So for sure they don't want to provide additional work in order to be able to use it	NULL
601	Depends on how extensive it gets.	NULL
602	Yeah.	NULL
603	I mean, if there are just a few terms probably would make sense.	NULL
604	Maybe they could even add their own translations.	F
605	Yeah.	NULL
606	But I think here it I'm with Chris because if I want to use the tool in my native language, I expect that the tool is, or yeah.	NULL
607	That I expect that the tool is a way otherwise it's already ran another tool.	NULL
608	Yeah, I think we have to keep it simple here as well for this project phase one and just go with three languages, German, English, and French and French, and just make sure that at the launch day, these languages are implemented completely.	F
609	So all the elements are there in three different languages and their manager, he can switch the language somewhere on a taco to his liking.	F
610	Okay.	NULL
611	And then maybe just keep the possibility in the backlog, but that's certainly not for phase one.	F
612	Okay.	NULL
613	I mean, yeah.	NULL
614	I mean, that's also, that's quite important for you and your team.	NULL
615	Only once you start developing the actual technical parts that this has to be highly scalable in the long run.	A
616	So we will be building up in phase two and may possible phase three on the existing framework.	NULL
617	So keep that in mind too.	NULL
618	Yeah.	NULL
619	I mean like a really nice coupling also from the front and backend that allows scalability.	A
620	Yeah.	NULL
621	I mean, I think we are at the we're at a very good point.	NULL
622	I got a lot of very good feedback from you guys.	NULL
623	Maybe we should leave it at that for now because I have another meeting, which I have to attend soon.	NULL
624	So I show it, just clarify some, some more things that might be unclear for you, because from my side, I'm quite happy with our outcome of this meeting.	NULL
625	Maybe just one question, you don't have to necessarily answer it now, but maybe note it down to, to get back to me whether the reports should be exportable, for example, to, to PDF files or anything, or, or CSV.	F
626	I don't know, because for now what we were talking about is that is all online in a widget or somewhere, but maybe, maybe you, he also has to report to someone else and would require it to as a file.	F
627	Yeah, I think the report should be shareable in some form.	F
628	It may be, I mean, there will be a lot of graphical elements in such a report like charts and yeah.	F
629	I mean, other bar plots and so on.	F
630	So maybe to make sense to, to make it available.	F
631	I'm sorry, I didn't get that.	NULL

644	And if yes, in which form it should come across.	NULL
645	I think PDF is fine for now because otherwise our customers would really be interested in data science of this particular specific surveys, which I highly doubt actually.	F

714	Yeah, a lot of verification.	NULL
715	That's why I'm saying like the contracts or whatever it is. It's almost like I don't want it to be a different approach. We're still filtering it down to, if you just want a map or not, the map is there. A lot of the times, I guess when it is...	NULL
716	To me, and we talked about this a little bit before. Getting this thing Notify, the HTML5, and getting the JRM functionality in, is imperative. I think we'll be able to sell a lot more and get a lot more recurring revenue if we do that.	NULL

731	As an Owner, I want to edit my profile, so that that it is updated with new information.	F
732	You don't want to box anybody in a corner, either. That doesn't do any good for Jasmine, to say, "OK, she's the UX person now."

741	That one, I think, was a misunderstanding. Because she's trying to change it to , because in it says the equipment's available but in LCAM, it's already sourced that equipment for another shipment, so it's not available in LCAM. I really think that issue is just confusion over the fact that, that piece of equipment had already been sourced for other orders.	NULL
742	Yeah.	NULL

760	I would prefer it to be consistent if we can make it consistent. It makes it easier, whether they use it or not, as long as it does work if they do choose to use it. It isn't required if they don't choose to use it. If I try to save this now, it's going to tell me something, estimate is required or something.	NULL

762	I see both sides of that. Whatever you want to do.	NULL

769	As a Broker user, I want to have PPoPZIP+4 work the same as the Legal Entity ZIP validations.	A

790	If somebody wants to do that for me, that would help me out.	NULL
791	They've got the scanner. They can have their cycle count up and scan the stuff in. That stuff sounds more like DC3, which I did have that thought when I was talking to him about it. I don't know why I didn't invite you to this meeting. My bad.	NULL

800	As a UI designer, I want to report to the Agencies about user testing, so that they are aware of their contributions to making Broker a better UX.	F
801	That would be in line with trying to give direction to new hires about where they need to invest their time, what type of technologies that you should probably be focusing on. That would feed in with our organizational goals as well.	NULL
802	I realize we didn't do the actual disconnect.	NULL

1908	Yeah.	NULL
1909	You'll add a task on that one. Who thinks he can get this done? For one thing, because, like I told him, I don't care if the tester gets updated because it needs to be tested with CTDI next week anyway.	NULL
1910	So if you can just get it done and then test with them and fix anything, then update the tester after the fact so that somebody can actually test against it, we could get away with that this time if we can get it in.	NULL

1912	Yeah, that'll knock some time off. Not having to update the tester.	NULL
1913	Yeah, as long as the tester gets updated like the week after or two weeks after so that it's available for when we need to do tests on the interface, because he's also off that week that you're off. That's why I'm like, stuff's got to be done. It's got to be right because you all are off, which is allowed. Just got to be done.	NULL

1921	If I could get an hour and a half, two hours together. I could finish that one. I'll finish today.	NULL

1923	Now you've put the pressure on me. Now I can't do it.	NULL
1924	build until next week.	NULL
1925	I'm just kidding. It's OK.	NULL
1926	We're going to be building 1.1 next week because we're going to have to because it has to be done next week so some of this stuff has to be being tested. If he can get this finished today and you all get everything merged back then you can make the build today but I would say let's wait on this because otherwise, the only thing we have is that report to test.	NULL
1927	The other report was available the last time you built for me. I just haven't tested it yet.	NULL

1932	Yeah, hopefully.	NULL
1933	Hopefully by Wednesday. I mean, it shouldn't take us that long to test. I put something like four hours down, because we've got to  the data and then we've to go in and play around with all the...	NULL
1934	I can knock out a good chunk of it today. There will be a good first look there. I'd hope you'd have something functional Wednesday, even if it's still rough.	NULL
1935	That sounds good. You all want to look at mine just so you all can laugh how I haven't done anything?	NULL
1936	There it is. All of this has my name on it. Let's see what Kevin  . Yeah, he's supposed to test that and...	NULL

1939	Which I can't do, yeah. And remove the header. That's the new...has nothing needed, right?	NULL
1940	Yeah, it's not ready yet either. That's the one Adam said if he could get two hours, he could get it done today.	NULL
1941	I've got the other two done.	NULL
1942	Do we have anything that we need to talk to them about today? No? That's good. Today is what? 3/18. Friday.	NULL
1943	What's the deal on the projects for the shipments coming in?  shipments.	NULL
1944	It was because the projects table had duplicates. It had multiple blanket projects in it. It was a conversion issue.	NULL
1945	So it's just getting the top one out of multiple matching...	NULL
1946	Yeah.	NULL
1947	I saw the email.	NULL

1968	That's not good.	NULL
1969	I think there were not just one or two. There were 70 some. Anyway. Do you just want us to put that together and email? Our concern is, we don't want to start putting stuff in there and get it confused with maybe an issue that already exists. You understand what I mean?	NULL
1970	That's kind of what we've used. We started using it because, for the Verizon assets, they wanted to keep up with the sequence number but then Brian was also using it to keep up with other data that he entered.	NULL
1971	If you look at the legacy ID field, he's had a pattern that he's used. He's actually out of the office today otherwise he could elaborate on that. It doesn't matter to us. We don't use that legacy ID field for anything.	NULL
1972	It will have the sequence number in it for the Verizon data so that it can be tied back to the Infinium or whatever that sequence number was related to. As far as the code, the code doesn't look at that legacy ID for anything.	NULL

2044	Like  , I don't have email in front of me, but basically you've got a high level...Susan's team, I guess when they go in there to do the approval. Pretty much the status is already set, so they're restricted, and can't redo something.	A
2045	An example would be of, it's like a forward stocking, LCAM says it's out there, but then when we talk tech with  , the packet is not there, or some some situation that can't use that. They can't go back and change it to pick it up in stock.	A
2046	Interesting.	NULL
2047	.	NULL
2048	They can do that. I responded to Jimmy's email, I think just a few minutes ago. The problem there is that she's looking at  to see what's available. The specific item that she gave an example on is not available in LCAM because it's already sourced for other shipments.	NULL
2049	I think she's doing the right process, but she's not looking in LCAM to see why it's telling her that, that equipment isn't available when she looks on the shelf. At least I think that's what that screenshot was of.	NULL
2050	I sent some screenshots and explained what I did. That might help.	NULL
2051	Go ahead.	NULL
2052	Did you put everyone through  ?	NULL
2053	I just sent it a few minutes ago. Let me see. I see...	NULL
2054	Actually, this is the one. This one I sent this morning.	NULL
2055	Mostly that was to Jimmy. I don't know if I  other one  . This one was from Linda. They were kind of describing the same thing. It has IM group on there. I don't know if you're part of that or not, Larry.	NULL
2056	Don't worry. I'll forward it to Larry. I've got it.  , Thank you.  related  .	NULL
2057	The other one is, it's related to the same situation, and maybe not. Let's say that  our  members ordered more  , and three of them are in stock, and one is not in stock.	NULL
2058	Normally, what we've done in the past is, we would be able to split that order so you would be able to push through and process  available. Create  a different order for the one that was not in stock. You would put in for that order's status.	F
2059	Whether they can or they can't do that, or if it's not possible, they have to be able to figure out how to do that.  is something that can be addressed, or...?	NULL
2060	You click that, and you can say split it off, and you can...	NULL
2061	Quantity...	NULL
2062	...orders are right...	NULL
2063	...with that one. Two, or one, or I don't really know...	NULL
2064	...line item. For that  . And then you treat it however you want to, whether you want to source it from your location, or...	NULL
2065	That one, I would...	NULL
2066	let them understand it and do the work...	NULL
2067	Wait a minute. They can split the order, but their question is the approval process. They said that we can't approve them separately.	NULL
2068	I understand what you're saying. So if you had, again, four items, you wanted, again, to split off to send to the vendor, are the other three automatically approved and sent forward?	NULL
2069	Once you approve the order. You have to, after you handle each of your detail line items, however you're going to handle, then you approve the whole order, and that's what  .	NULL
2070	, I don't have any experts on. Are they having to...If they approve  item to go  stock, or  , they approve it all, would there be a reason they couldn't approve ? We had that problem with   departmental request...	NULL
2071	that's really not an LCAM issue.	NULL
2072	So even though they have it, they can't  because they have to wait for the part number available in the item  so they can approve.	NULL
2073	I think somebody had made a request. I don't know exactly what it was, but it was something like BMA will just put a status on the order other than approve, and I think  or waiting on  was what they were talking about.	NULL
2074	We'll take it back to them  look at the next one  more.	NULL
2075	He already covered the split, over here, and stuff we just talked about  if they can't change that source, I don't know what we're doing wrong.	NULL
2076	That one, I think, was a misunderstanding. Because she's trying to change it to  , because in  it says the equipment's available but in LCAM, it's already sourced that equipment for another shipment, so it's not available in LCAM. I really think that issue is just confusion over the fact that, that piece of equipment had already been sourced for other orders.	NULL
2077	They've got something that...	NULL
2078	...it's wired. It will say quantity allocated  not showing allocated yet.	NULL
2079	That's what I think, because we've been only picking up like every 20 minutes or so.	NULL
2080	All right, I'll take that back to them.	NULL
2081	And if that's not the case, then let me know. If we need to have a little WebX or something, and go through some of this...	NULL
2082	That may be an excellent idea.	NULL
2083	If they come up with their scenarios, and we can do the WebX...	NULL
2084	This situation, we can do this.	NULL
2085	I think  to do that  decisions for that. I think there may be more to it, but I think some it is absolutely just confusion.	NULL
2086	That's to be expected with a new system. It's different.	NULL
2087	In the first week. The first three times you do it.	NULL
2088	, that would be best. It doesn't matter when   .	NULL
2089	I don't  that.	NULL
2090	Yeah. I can do that. It will probably be Wednesday before I can schedule it. I'm pretty booked up. I'll send some...	NULL
2091	.	NULL
2092	Who all do you want? Or should I just send it to you two, and you all can send it to whoever?	NULL
2093	You can just send it to  it doesn't matter, as long as it's  .	NULL
2094	OK. All good.	NULL
2095	Larry, Karen's concern with the ship via CLLIs, and then the CLLI code that  , we need them. We're working on reviewing that in-house first, OK?	NULL
2096	Yeah. I got it.  .	NULL
2097	Yeah, I've done that. We're working on where that might be confusing. And the other item, I don't know if we've had it out there before, but the  group, and, well, both groups, I don't know if it's on anything, but CLLI code with the wild card...That's a big request.	F
2098	I don't remember that one.	NULL
2099	.	NULL
2100	Perfect.	NULL
2101	Clean it up, there.	NULL
2102	Guess it's not  I want to say. I think it is. There's so much on there, as	NULL
2103	Right, and that's generally across any  search criteria. That'd be great.	NULL
2104	Ken, Is that mainly when you're trying to search for spares in a cluster location?	NULL
2105	I didn't get to read anything, but that would be one of the few reasons.	A
2106	Happy.	NULL
2107	Said it was  .	NULL
2108	Gather up...	NULL
2109	On the order approval screen they'd be trying to change to SE for a line item.	NULL
2110	Yes.	NULL
2111	Drake? Can you see how substitution works in LCAM?	NULL
2112	Yeah. As long as it's a valid substitute, you should be able to edit that line item and change the SE, or you can split it, put in a substitute for that particular asset. It has to be in our table for substitutes.	A
2113	Why would you split it if it's  ?	NULL
2114	We wouldn't unless it...	NULL
2115	You wouldn't unless you...	NULL
2116	Whenever they can't put that in, they need to let me know what it is, and we can check the sub table to see what's wrong. If it's valid we can update the sub table.	F
2117	Going to be a big one, but...	NULL
2118	Suckers.	NULL
2119	Larry, I guess that covers what we were talking about.	NULL
2120	Yeah. Yes, sir.	NULL
2121	Then for the IBT group that we were trying to target, most critical thing, what's coming up and biggest holdback is SCC scan error correction screen. First request,  , go to the active logs  . We're finding everything. Narrow those certain criteria. With project-related, OK.	NULL
2122	Otherwise they're struggling, fishing through the errors, and I think they're overwhelmed. First of all, we have a lot of errors. They usually have that cleaned up  .	NULL
2123	We were talking about different things. There's not an Infinium company, probably that'd come into play. The CLLI code, not only a wild card. There's some code, I'm no expert, I put a underscore four times, a  , 08, then a percent. It'll know that the specific, fixed character was for 08. You know what I'm saying?	NULL
2124	Yes.	NULL
2125	I can do that.	NULL
2126	Have a general  target for their assigned areas  Indiana, Ohio, and  instead of fishing through  .	NULL
2127	...on the list.	NULL
2128	If you have other ideas, just to generalize it, that'd be good. The target project, that's OK. That's there, but otherwise they struggle.	NULL
2129	You don't look at it. See what it is? It should be just be  .	NULL
2130	...I'm thinking Susan's already got that on the list.	NULL
2131	...that can be brought up before releases, and even without releases. Is there a reprocess feature overnight to take something  ?	NULL
2132	Grady, are you on the room?	NULL
2133	Yeah, I'm here. Reprocessing from the SCC page?	NULL
2134	No. He's talking about...Aren't you talking about whenever we release or whenever we want to, to try to reprocess everything that's in the SCC screen for you?	NULL
2135	Yeah. I finished a script recently, was finishing up early this morning, to take all those and get them back to where they'll go through workflow again, reprocess so I can execute that procedure.	NULL
2136	Would you like us to run that overnight, Jim?	NULL
2137	Yeah, that would be helpful.	NULL
2138	I can.	NULL
2139	Grady wasn't able to finish for Friday night's release. They were trying to  . He'll run that after about six pm central time today. That should get anything that would have changed in the release and that's still sitting in the FCC screen. That should at least get rid of any of that.	NULL
2140	...a canned query. I can't remember what the title was called, of the report. I'd have to  double check it. She was getting some random results and others were getting good results  query, sensitive to multi, people trying to use it at the same time. The point is that current results were impaired.	NULL
2141	They got the same thing two or three times and got different results.	NULL
2142	Do you know which report she was running?	NULL
2143	I figured you'd ask that, so I'll get back with you on that.	NULL
2144	Thanks.	NULL
2145	It was on an email but I can't...	NULL
2146	I don't want to  , anyway.	NULL
2147	It'll take me a minute. If you could give me the date so I can open it up, that's fine.  .	NULL
2148	Those are the kind of issues that scare the crap out of me. I know they're trying to use it.	NULL
2149	...promotion screen, at the same time...	NULL
2150	0.999.  91...	NULL
2151	...really not minor. I don't even know. I'm assuming that it's still open.	NULL
2152	It is still open. You shouldn't...	NULL
2153	Don't want it to get lost.	NULL
2154	It is  .	NULL
2155	Why are they...?	NULL
2156	One last thing.	NULL
2157	They'll at least use a CPR code and...	NULL
2158	We're getting a lot of calls from the techs, and I've been trying to email. It was 3/11. I am sorry, folks.	NULL
2159	Sorry about that,  in my pocket.	NULL
2160	I'm scanning transactions, email of March 11. It's not  . Reply  , so there's  question from Nicole and Peggy. They're working on .  getting critical. You need me to forward that email again? You know what I'm talking about?	NULL
2161	Yes. I haven't replied to it, and it's old, and I probably moved it. I know last week you and Ken were going to get together about what the roles would need to be for the month's scanning  . That determines what screens they can see. Still send me that email and I'll look at it and see if I can  it.	NULL
2162	. Thank you. That'll do it for now.	NULL
2163	Get a high level  . Going to pick up a new Verizon 3  Larry, we've got to get that request for approval smoothed out, and get this scanning process correct the errors  down a little bit.	NULL
2164	Hopefully the WebX I'll set up for Wednesday will help.	NULL
2165	Larry, do you have anything else?	NULL
2166	No, sir. I'm good.	NULL
2167	That's it for me, too.	NULL
2168	Thanks, everybody. Hope you...	NULL
2169	Well, Susan's on her way to the large. Do we need to catch her?	NULL
2170	Yeah, because I mean it's 3:30.	NULL
2171	Susan is right.	NULL
2172	Who is this, Joy?	NULL
2173	It's Kaitlin.	NULL
2174	Hey, Kaitlin.	NULL
2175	Hi Greg. It's all the rest of your friends.	NULL
2176	Not all of them.	NULL
2177		NULL
2178	OK, Jim, Kaitlin, Kim, I think, and DJ.	NULL
2179	OK, this important thing about the meeting is sent an email saying what was going to be in the release tonight, so you'll be getting the release tonight. What else do we need to talk about?	NULL
2180	I just have one thing. This is Adam. I did get the list of fans from Brian. I haven't started working on those, but I did get those recently, so I'll start working on getting those resolved.	NULL
2181	All right. Thanks.	NULL
2182	Feel great things.	NULL
2183	Great things they were better than that.	NULL
2184	OK, Anybody else have any updates?	NULL
2185	It's hilarious that they're in there.	NULL
2186	It's a lot...a little bit ago what you're doing with the Thursdays?  Did Kim even join?	NULL
2187	I thought I heard Kim, but,  sure who did join.	NULL
2188	Yeah, it is...I always hear them on calls .	NULL
2189	I don't know. Every time I hear Kim I think of the girl sort of like...I've never heard it as a man's name before.	NULL
2190	OK I will let you know that... I'll just let you know that one of the folks that is supporting our virtual server advised us that it appears there's a possibility that the application could be using reports and not releasing them.	NULL
2191	We're not saying that that's happening, so the thing now is doing that today. put a monitor on those codes just so that he can see that they're being released. Other than that, he was not able to find out what, if there was a network issue, it was. Before we can root cause it so it doesn't happen again, I wanted to make sure that it's not a port issue, so he's taking care of that.	NULL
2192	And that's all I have.	NULL
2193	All right. We will talk to you guys tomorrow.	NULL
2194	It records. It's red. It records  and you can plug it in here and it will search all your notes. It can take it up.	NULL
2195	Seriously?	NULL
2196	Mm-hm. Look at the paper. It's super cool.	NULL
2197	This is works?	NULL
2198	When you push record, it starts recording what you write, and there's a little camera in here, and it picks up the things that...	NULL
2199	Are you serious?	NULL
2200	Yeah, I'm completely serious. I have, what, 73 pages since I came here? I'll probably fill it up by the time I leave. Then I can remember because I'm not doing my research stuff for the data analysis until October, so I need to remember everything I can remember. It's really cool. I didn't use it at first, and then I was like, "I should try it." My handwriting is terrible. Look at that. It picks it up. It's fantastic.	NULL
2201	It is. It's really cool.	NULL
2202	It's super awesome. I didn't buy it. I made Notre Dame buy it. I was like...	NULL
2203	...made. Before we go, we'll figure it out and get the best of the usual releases. Conduit...	NULL
2204	What about that?	NULL
2205	We got in a request that's, as per usual, something that needs to be done within the next month so I asked them what they wanted to push out and pretty much Conduit with The Elite. A way of possibilities so we'll be replacing MAT point and configurable palette with the MAT powders. Adam and Miranda are given at the best in Michael's help. I already told them the Conduit stuff, we just have a slot for them.	NULL
2206		NULL
2207	Well, get started on it. I'd say go ahead, but until we have the meeting happening.	NULL
2208	If we get a meeting  .	NULL
2209	Yes, if we can get the meeting and get stories. If Patrick has time again with the performance issue, any type thing, and you're becoming familiar with it then that's great.  , customer support?	NULL
2210	That's open.	NULL
2211	And, then Frontier. So can you all get together and get Frontier scheduled for  ?	NULL
2212	We want them scheduled like April the fourth, right? That's that Monday?	NULL
2213	April fourth or  .	NULL
2214	Can you add the PUD and the sub power on the northwest engine of that database? I honestly keep forgetting to do it.	NULL
2215	Can you remember when we get down to that thing?	NULL
2216	I think we're on that section. I want them to be trained.	NULL
2217	Got you.	NULL
2218	I want them to be listed as a group, those three companies to be trained on Front Desk. That and PUD and the sub powering on the northwest engine. Jesse, when you get to that, then I'll give you the contact names. I don't have them off the top of my head.	NULL
2219	You need to talk to  . We have residents there to notify people. We need to get him on board. OK, we have decided on the Agile Class, and I am gonna get it scheduled based on everybody's calenders. John wanted us to bring a couple of the Denver people in. Talked to Matt yesterday about trying to make sure it all works with their calenders, as well. We are going do a one day class. It will probably be late April, early May would be my guess.	NULL
2220	Where would that be, then?	NULL
2221	Here?	NULL
2222	Well I think the question is are the people...	NULL
2223	I just saw the number of people.	NULL
2224	Here we are...	NULL
2225	It's going to be our team, Jules' team, and then a couple guys from Denver. So we can open that up. We'll figure out how to do it.	NULL
2226	OK, HTML file  .	NULL
2227	I've asked  for these flashback construction engineering. I told them engineering is done, and, construction, I told them we're not planning on doing anything this quarter.	NULL
2228	At least not  .	NULL
2229	They were supposed to get together and talk back with me but they haven't yet, so whatever. All right, Frontier?	NULL
2230	It's awesome!	NULL
2231	What's the real story?	NULL
2232	We're probably going to have another emergency release tonight around, I'd say, 7:00 or 8:00. How many days passed?	NULL
2233	Presently, those release counters, how many business days have we...	NULL
2234	That's exactly...close one, because we did not do one on Monday. We did one on Sunday, didn't do it on Monday. We did one Sunday with every business position.	NULL
2235	There will be nothing to worry about right now.	NULL
2236	We really messed with Paige's report. Seems like being every bad day out there with all the sudden releases.	NULL
2237	Not very happy about it. What about the people for that date?	NULL
2238	Apparently, we're going to be converting those assets at some time on Saturday, April the 2nd over Verizon. As far as where the rest of the release is, Drake's trying to not have email up, and get his work done for the release and quit working on emergency releases. He's trying to keep it down so that he can get caught up. Everybody else, I guess, is on track. Nobody said they were stuck.	NULL
2239	There's no way you could  . 30,000 locations have fallen out right now.	NULL
2240	Are they answering your questions?	NULL
2241	Just so we are clear, your stuff is what you get done by April 2nd. After that it becomes their stuff, unless they decide to push after release. I know that's not the best possible solution we can turn over, but that's the one that they had given us. If they refuse to push that day, and they say they'll handle the fallout. There we go. Karen?	NULL
2242	I can't read the  . Whole transfer stuff...as far as I know we are on track for delivering at the end of the month, their go by date. Right now is April 4th. I do have some questioning on reports. They didn't give me four reports that they want. There's not a whole lot of detail in there. They said they need this before we go live.	NULL
2243	I'm meeting with Des, I think tomorrow, on those reports. That's our top priority from them. Des keeps working on that. We're meeting with them Thursday again, so they can decide what option they want to go with. So we can make progress on that. That will not meet the 31st day period. There's no way that's going to happen.	NULL
2244	But we did tell her that yesterday.	NULL
2245	Yes, we did.	NULL
2246	The sooner we know things are going to meet dates,  the better we can set expectations to them.	NULL
2247	The Dashboard is done, as far as I'm concerned.	NULL
2248	Are you sure? Nobody  today.	NULL
2249	Yes. Kevin's been writing those stories. We have a meeting probably Sunday, so  test cases.  . Then we have the planning  early this week or next week, it may not be this week. Sometime next week it should be done  , as far as the whole thing goes, hopefully.	NULL
2250	Marcy has sent questions over to the engineers, basically in charge of the engineering request. I guess we'll make an emergency release for that report. I'm talking about this...then we've talked about this sustainment team. We've loosely got Jasmine and Miranda as the sustainment team right now.	NULL
2251	Miranda we've kind of pulled off a little bit, to work on this emergency one month, mapping things with Adam. Right now Jasmine is the sustainment team. We just had a meeting with United Illuminating, because they had a bunch of tickets kind of following...Karen's got a bunch of schedule work to do.	NULL
2252	The whole point of this sustainment team-creating is to try to limit the distractions and do our schedule part. What we said out of this...we had that meeting. Joel and Karen ran it, talked to the customer and asked questions back and forth. What we really want is Jesse and Jasmine running that meeting.	NULL
2253	The tickets come in to Jesse, if he can't figure it out, if it's a coding thing, something that needs to be looked at in the code, questions that he has, or things that need to be configured. Then he would go to the sustainment team, and then they're able to look into the code, probably make some database changes. At first they're going to have a lot of questions, so we will be subject matter experts that they'll go to.	NULL
2254	So they might schedule a 10, 15 minute question and answer session where they will write down...so we won't have to sit there keeping notes, managing it all, making sure it all gets done, making sure the tickets get resolved -- that'll be the sustainment team responsibility -- we'll just be there answering questions. So they'll ask the questions, write down the answers, update the tickets, and then we just...obviously at first they're going to have a lot of questions to us about how things work. So that will be our responsibility right now, just to answer those questions.	NULL
2255	Then as we move on into maybe some people roll on onto that team  that'll allow him to ask people in other applications questions so we'll all work through this cross-training opportunity.  . Do we have?	NULL
2256	We had some stuff that Jasmine did and we haven't released it yet, a couple of things we found, new items, we're fixing the other two. Jeremy's CTL needs to be added on that list too. That has the same thing, there were some things that were...	NULL
2257	checking everything she did   .	NULL
2258	...put over there too, I don't know what they are off the top of my head.	NULL
2259	Do I need to be notified? Releases?	NULL
2260	No.	NULL
2261	I don't know, let's...	NULL
2262	1.20 is the one that's going out at the end of the month.	NULL
2263		NULL
2264	Based on what new tech 1.10 out on, that is...	NULL
2265		NULL
2266	1.20 might need to be moved up some depending on what option they take on the fast path. That's the one having to get it checked in. I guess we owe him that with a clean release so we may go with 20 a little bit earlier.	NULL
2267	The HTML files will be the release and then we'll work it like an Agile thing where if we have an emergency release or one month release, there might be things that are doable and releaseable, to production during that thing, and this thing of a couple of releases, I guess, probably.	NULL
2268	Today what I did was -- for this meeting -- sometimes I hear the complaint throughout the years that people don't know what other people are doing. So today, rather than staying on track off track, I kind of had everybody give a little bit more color to the things so you all can let me know if you like that or don't like that. That way at least we all kind of know what's going on, and what's coming and what's in range, and whatever people are working on. I'm sorry that's as far as it goes. One minute.	NULL
2269	So we're going to do this upgrade to TFS. I think the upgrade is 2015, then we can hire Paige to come in for a couple of weeks and let everything go forwards.	NULL
2270	I think that'll be very helpful to run on  ...we'll just still  higher, for that one, and then...	NULL
2271	OK so I want...we always say this and everybody gets locked up in their day to day, I would like everyone in this room to submit something by next week  , just an idea, just anything that they're interested in technology-wise, that will force us all to...if you don't have anything pressing, at least it'll get the brain ticking a little bit about, "Hey, what might I be interested in?"	NULL
2272	Because you know, we do have this core value about being driven and wanting to grow and wanting to expand our knowledge in anything I guess, and I guess it doesn't necessarily have to be  , you could just be technology thing, it could be application thing, it could be "I want to know more about how nuts and bolts and  works." Whatever.	NULL
2273	I want to get lunch, something to eat if you want me to  . It can be anybody.	NULL
2274	We've got a lot of knowledge in this room so we just want to take advantage of that. I would like every single person to submit something. I would say go into the spread sheet and just put your idea down here somewhere. I've created an ideas tab on here so everybody can just go put your idea on the ideas tab this week.	NULL
2275	OK, set-up time for new hires, for training classes. I think Jesse's coming to work in a bit with...	NULL
2276	I know, he said  .	NULL
2277	Yeah. He's been unofficially now. We'll get a target and more formalized, with this on-boarding process. I want to talk to Brandon and Jasmine and get their input, Paige I guess as well, about what could we do better. I met with you guys a little bit about this same thing.	NULL
2278	All right, so we took a little bit more time today talking about the status of where everything's at. Does anybody have any issues or anything that we can take off of this list? I guess it decreases every time, those tabs.	NULL
2279	Does anybody else need...I know Susan,  and Jesse are the...	NULL
2280	.	NULL
2281	OK. Does anybody feel the need to do a formal touch-base on the ticketing process?	NULL
2282	and I would like a refresher, since it's been a few months since she showed us how to do it.	NULL
2283	Yeah, some new members. I think we need a refresher course.	NULL
2284	We'll set that up.	NULL
2285	What is the set up that today  would go for support fails, they need access really to  pick up some of the support, and so I asked Kevin about it, and of course they don't want to send us the  , so how are we going to analyse  because we don't want to have to give mainframe access for everybody  .	NULL
2286	Be able to keep  to be able to discuss that, make sure that we're good, legally, or to  .	NULL
2287	On the support thing, when work stoppage issues come through and it's during the day, can we assume that you will get in touch with the right person, so I can delete that email until...	NULL
2288	You can just take your name off the list  .	NULL
2289	...if someone gets...	NULL
2290	every time one comes in   ...	NULL
2291	Do I need to look at it?	NULL
2292	...the handling goes and that's why I always  ...	NULL
2293	Only reason why I left you two on the list of people that get notified is like what if I'm sick that day.	NULL
2294	That's fine. If I can assume you will get to the right person, I will delete it, unless you're out of the office.	NULL
2295	Here's what I would prefer is if we did...When you have it, if you can send a reply to the big blue  . Whoever's got it, everybody also knows, because you know it's just like that  people, then likely nobody's doing  .	NULL
2296	"Hey, I have it," type thing.	NULL
2297	Yeah, or the opposite of that is three people will be looking at the same thing. I would like a, "Hey, we got it," type thing. I don't know what's the best way to do that. Maybe you go ahead and change the ticket  if you could do that, as soon as you're looking at it.	NULL
2298	I could just do some kind of a standardized thing, like we've received a ticket and we'll provide an update when we have more...Just something like that, to know that I've actually seen it  that response  the ticket. It can be something as simple as that.	NULL
2299	Just some way that so we'll know  you're not here, then I'll probably handle one of them.	NULL
2300	I don't know that you're not here now since I'm not always there.	NULL
2301	Anything else?  .	NULL
2302	I forgot what it was.	NULL
2303	to add, is there anything you want to ask or talk about  or suggest? I know right now we're still making  so the process changes and trying to hold on  process changes and also that we've touched a lot of issues  . I had you all feeling good on the HTML file as far as this iteration   .	NULL
2304	Can you put in something that  I don't think anyone has decided on how they want it to be laid out yet. That's the last I heard.	NULL
2305	Writing?	NULL
2306	Pardon?	NULL
2307	Writing? You're writing  .	NULL
2308	Me?	NULL
2309	Yeah, 1 through 10.	NULL
2310	No.	NULL
2311	I already a  .	NULL
2312	How long ago?	NULL
2313	Who's next?	NULL
2314	.	NULL
2315	Eight.	NULL
2316	I'm trying to understand...	NULL
2317	About the...? OK.	NULL
2318	throw some numbers.	NULL
2319	Just the effectiveness of it, the point in writing it is to try get more vision in the meeting and try to make sure that things are useful, the information is useful, that we're not wasting time, that we're solving issues. Right now, I've got the meeting schedule, so sure, there's difficult-to-solve issues.	NULL
2320	My hope out of this is that we raise issues and then that we can form little teams together to try to solve the issues as we go and get all that stuff on the table, and then to give information to everybody, since a lot of people  complained about not knowing what everybody else is working on, things like that. Just giving a little color of what everybody's working on.	NULL
2321	addressing all the concerns we have   .	NULL
2322	Yeah, addressing the concerns and just letting everybody  .	NULL
2323	necessarily address those, upgrade and have triage   .	NULL
2324	If I see a bunch sixes or sevens or something or a bunch of tens and somebody uses a seven, then it's like, "Why is it?" and then try to address what the concern is. So like Patrick in  , what would make it better than a seven?	NULL
2325	Knocking some stuff off the list. It is helpful. It is generally good, but not has been better or worse than the other. We've started knocking stuff off the list and maybe  get more fuzzy  .	NULL
2326	I've got the same concerns. It seems like we  , but not much is getting rubbed off.	NULL
2327	I think that it's probably a good idea to go ahead and make it 45 minutes. I think we can use the extra 15 minutes. I try to start small, see what we can get done, but it seems like...That's always my issues, too, when I was managing things, knocking things off.	NULL
2328	I gave it an eight today instead of a seven because we did add and take a couple things off and put things on the to-do list. We talked about the support thing. We didn't solve anything big, but at least we made a little bit of progress.	NULL
2329	There was one thing you mentioned earlier on, TFS 2013, and so that  pops up in my head. The simple solution  in 2012, Frontier we're on 2013, are we going to...?	NULL
2330	Everything would be on the same.	NULL
2331	Are we?	NULL
2332	Yeah  where all of our products are  .	NULL
2333	We're going by TFS where everything is and everything can do that well right now. I've got my Visual Studio.	NULL
2334	I'm talking Visual Studio. We need to  .	NULL
2335	We can actually put that...	NULL
2336	...so that you're all  .	NULL
2337	That's the kind of thing that we want to capture, put on the issues log and  .	NULL
2338	I don't think it's a to-do yet, because I don't think we're at a point to do it. I think we're going to have to figure out how we're going to do it, because we have at least three right now. We have 2010, 2012 and 2013. I think it needs some discussion around strategy to do it first, before it becomes a to-do, and then once we do that then it could be something to do, someone actually doing it.	NULL
2339	That's all...anything else  .	NULL
2340	I'm getting a little loopy.	NULL
2341	Very well. Understood. That's for sure.	NULL
2342	It's a lot of emails I've gone through. I've gone through more in the last two weeks than ever in a two week time span. OK. Did you all have anything specific you wanted to talk about?	NULL
2343	Speaking of emails. Earlier in the week, Susan, I sent you an email about location groups.	NULL
2344	I haven't gotten back to that one yet. I do remember reading it...Stop it!	NULL
2345	Slacker.	NULL
2346	Slacker? That's me. Goofing off. I'll find out the answers and get them to you.	NULL
2347	Thank you. Would that be related to the ICP clusters?	NULL
2348	Yeah. I know Peggy and I talked about it, because she was working on some documentation and had a few questions  sent on to Susan.	NULL
2349	One of Larry's group  was wondering...I don't know, I hope it's in an email about, I think Susan or somebody explained you could  location groups, or there wasn't an opportunity to do global ones. We need to get those clusters back in, or started.	NULL
2350	Anything else that we need to talk about?	NULL
2351	Jim, do you have anything else?	NULL
2352	No, I'm good.	NULL
2353	So, Jim, the last email that Brian sent in regards to those CLLIs that we can't match as an exchange? I know we're getting down to the wire. I don't think that Ken and I can weigh in on that, as to what he wants to do.	A
2354	I've got it open, here. That was one of my two things, so I'll jump to that one. Yeah, Brian...Let's see, where are we? The company plant couldn't find a CLLI code.	F
2355	Actually, a different email  . Ship this one.	NULL
2356	It was probably...It kind of looks like it. I did just company, plant at first. Then I tried company, plant, and zip code. I got a little bit better results with that. There's still the company, plant combination either doesn't exist in the CLLIs that exist in those network element files, or the combination yields too many...There's not a distinct exchange, otherwise, for that combination.	NULL
2357	What are you bouncing off of? I don't know.	NULL
2358	There was three files. DJ, would probably be better to chime in on this one.	NULL
2359	It was network elements, Jim, that I was provided by Cathy Johns. I gave him those three documents that match. It was network elements and the OAC. The other one was asset accounting. Do you want a copy of them?	NULL
2360	Asset accounting?	NULL
2361	Asset accounting was the OAC and the...	NULL
2362	OK. No. Let me just back up then. That's good enough to get me started to help. I know that it's critical, seeing what we missed. In my explanation, I'd say, is there any way to take that company plant, that you said we figured was buried in that, through those CLLI codes?	NULL
2363	Use that company plant to first map to the CLLI six of the  key data? Oh, so you did do that.	NULL
2364	Yes.	NULL
2365	With that, you'd have to go over to Cathy Johns, OK.	NULL
2366	Right.	NULL
2367	That doesn't make sense. I'm not questioning you but...	NULL
2368	I totally understand.	NULL
2369	. You're saying for company plant combination, like in California, 9WC whatever plan code, that could come to us, there's multiple CLLI sixes? Leave out the building?	NULL
2370	Not necessarily different CLLI sixes, but those CLLI sixes didn't have the state exchange codes.	NULL
2371	Really?	NULL
2372	Yeah.	NULL
2373	These don't look like anything I've ever seen before, so Ken and I were talking about it, and...	NULL
2374	So, I'm scared to do anything on these, because I don't want there to be bad accounting data on there, but I also don't want them to fall out, either. Could I maybe take the most popular exchange code out of the...? That's kind of almost a quirky,  thing to do, and I feel like exactly like what Susan motioned to do, like I'm kind of throwing a dart.	NULL
2375	DJ, if I pull up 9WC0201, you're going to get a long list of company plants, different sub plants, and you're going to get some valid CLLI codes, and invalid ones. To me, an exchange boundary  like Marion, Ohio added one exchange, and then small little remotes off of Marion, it's the same exchange. I thought the exchange was a broader, defining area, so I was hoping.	NULL
2376	It sounds like that didn't work. What did we do with the net pseudos?	NULL
2377	That was the lowly thing about net, is that each of the pseudos itself had the company code on there. In the net table itself, the CO profile table, there was that Infinium company code OAC in exchange field for each record.	NULL
2378	That's because we went in and cleaned those up prior to passing the data to you.	NULL
2379	Which is going to be more difficult, and probably impossible to do in this case, because you could probably clean them up  extract 4, but then when we get the next extract, then there's going to be more stuff in there, potentially, that we haven't even considered. It would be nice if we had more broader swath.	NULL
2380	I like Jim's rules, that mindset of, if we had CLLI six, we could map it to an exchange that way. That was incredibly beneficial. It's just it's not fully working.	NULL
2381	Don't you all have to, or somebody have to map these CLLIs to Infinium?	NULL
2382	The pseudo ones?	NULL
2383	Yeah. Or do they not use the pseudos in Infinium?	NULL
2384	Like Ken said, in net we already clean them up, so yeah, we'll eventually have to map them to Infinium.	NULL
2385	No, I mean for Infinium to go live with this Verizon data in April, doesn't somebody have to map this stuff? I don't understand.	NULL
2386	They'll map it by...I'll check with the Infinium folks.	NULL
2387	DJ, I know you haven't said this directly, but isn't some of the work that the IT department is going to be doing on this data before we get it, some of the work that they have to do so that Infinium will have their information on that, to the Verizon...?	NULL
2388	I said, I didn't finish my thought. Now remember, in Infinium, they don't even look at the CLLI code.  thing, so they're just looking at the company plant, sub plant, and going by the CO code and business unit. They're defining it that way. So, Infinium doesn't even look at these pseudo-CLLIs or CLLIs. Go ahead, DJ, I interrupted you to answer the other part.	NULL
2389	I just wanted to clarify.	NULL
2390	No, that's good.	NULL
2391	Pulling it in  , it's like you said. This doesn't have anything to do with the CLLIs, but, you'd think there was something that we could match it up with.	NULL
2392	Those three digits, let me send out another file, but, those three digits that have  from the very top, if you look at 225WC, the does WC stand for wire center? Or not?	NULL
2393	She told me about...	NULL
2394	No, it was out in California. 9WC was the company code.	NULL
2395	Since the Infinium folks are going to have to deal with this, probably on the case-by-case basis as they encounter the new sub plants, I assume, could we put maybe a placeholder on these that we can't figure out and get them in that way? And then they could be dealt with on the case-by-case basis as they get encountered in LCAM? Is that a possibility?	NULL
2396	That's a good question. Ken, we need to get with Sarah, I think,  she's got to go into Infinium anyway, and fixed assets, so we should be able to get those exchanges.	NULL
2397	. The data that she sent to you...	NULL
2398	So if that's true, then we could probably just come up with a pattern, like Drake said, of an exchange code. Because the exchange code helps me link back to that other file that DJ gave me that had that exhaustive list of LACs and company codes. I've had not a single problem matching up the exchange codes I've found back to that list, so I think that's perfect there.	NULL
2399	The only thing that I would need to put in there would be a place holder for the exchange code, the company code, and the OAC. If we just came up with some sort of thing that, it's blatantly obvious to whoever's using that part of LCAM, goes, "Oh, yeah, I know I need to do this when I come across this," then that would at least get  through this part to the next thing.	NULL
2400	So, if that's OK with you guys, I'll just...we'll figure out what looks good based on the data that we've got and email that to you guys. You can either say, "Yeah I like that," or "No, I don't like that, go back, dummy and go try it again," and we'll try it again.	NULL
2401	Yeah, sounds good.	NULL
2402	Jim, did you say you had two items on your list?	NULL
2403	Ken, are you OK with that? DJ.	NULL
2404	Yeah. That sounds like a good solution, short term, to me.	NULL
2405	It was quite a while ago, and to be honest, it could have been you that said it or somebody else. Neither here nor there. That's the next barrier I'm coming across, is I need to know whether or not the G team's ship-to code is indeed a valid ship-to code for those locations that are in the extract. If they are, I'll need those addresses. I really just don't know where to find them, if they are in the extract or not.	F
2406	If they're not, I need to strip those out, but we'd also need to know whether we can or can't ship a plug to one of those particular locations, and if something needs to go there, where it needs to be shipped to, via, to get there.	A
2407	I hesitate to pull NetLogic out, because it seems to me like it'd be a mess if it got into LCAM without a via location specified, and somebody tried to ship something directly to someplace in the middle of nowhere.	NULL
2408	That seems like that would be a worse problem to clean up than the alternative, but I can do whatever you guys feel is the better of the two evils. If we can't get the ship-to's in time, that is. I know you're relying on somebody else to get us that information, I just...	NULL
2409	I've got a call in to  . I guess I can call again. Everybody's busy who's on call. So Ken, if we didn't have a ship-to via on some of these, I think you're going to be...I don't even know what we would ship to those pseudos.	NULL
2410	We probably aren't shipping to them, but I'm not sure all the intricacies between  and G teams, and how G teams was handling that. I haven't looked at the G teams data, either. Brian, have you been looking at the G teams data?	NULL
2411	I don't know where to find it, to be honest.	NULL
2412	OK.	NULL
2413	I saw the reference to it, and I'm not seeing any foreign key constraints to another table from the ice locations table, but I haven't looked...	NULL
2414	Most of these didn't have constraints, I think. I think they had interfaces built between separate databases. DJ, should I do some digging into G teams?	NULL
2415	Let me ask somebody over at the Verizon land the question. That way, you don't have to waste your time if I can get some information.	NULL
2416	That would be of help. Thank you.	NULL
2417	You're very welcome.	NULL
2418	So, is the option on the via ship-to...Can that also just have a filler that would prompt others to react to it?	NULL
2419	Can we just put a pseudo-pseudo...	NULL
2420	Pseudo-pseudo.	NULL
2421	I'm starting to feel out of conception here, but a pseudo-pseudo CLLI, that we put as the via location for all of the ones that have a via location, and that can be the place holder, then go, "Oh, I need to figure out where to ship this to," and we could have that as a dummy address, maybe? I don't know what that would look like, but, something.	NULL
2422	Would they all be the same? Pseudo-pseudo?	NULL
2423	Yeah. Every G team ship code that we have, we would just map it to alpha.	NULL
2424	Ship unknown or something like that. Load base alpha  .	NULL
2425	Yeah, we can try that, Jim.	NULL
2426	What do you think, Ken? DJ?	NULL
2427	We can't find any real data that would at least get the records transferred in without fallout.	NULL
2428	That'd be good, as long as there's something there and we know we've got to go back to it.  target. What we have for  logistics is  ship to  .	NULL
2429	Yeah. They should have those, right?	NULL
2430	Yeah. I need to get back with them. I haven't sent any replies. Plus, he didn't call me back.	NULL
2431	That did bring me to another question. I can't find warehouses in the data at all, and I know that, Ken, we got feedback from you to look at the building type field that's there, and that was beneficial. We found the field locations, and may denote it as CS, which I assume is Central Stock. RDC Remote Distribution Center, and then I think an IDC is an Intermediate Distribution Center.	NULL
2432	The CSs, the HCSs, and I think the RDPs even, RDCs, and net we treated as forward stocking locations, and we had a static list of CLLIs that we knew to be warehouses. But I don't have a static list or anything like that for the Verizon ones.	NULL
2433	I looked at non-working to working plug ratios, and I noticed that the central stock ones, or the building type designating them as central stock locations, had pretty much zero percent working plugs, which sounded to me like it could be either a warehouse or a forward stocking location.	NULL
2434	But their FRCs were like 357C, so that didn't sound like a warehouse to me. I did find...	NULL
2435	Go ahead, I'm sorry.	NULL
2436	Well I know...To cut in there, I just found out not too long ago that Verizon changed their policy on reuse items. They are leaving the capital account. I just wanted to let you know that those 357Cs, that was reused stuff.  .	NULL
2437	I did find several locations that seemed to be where the primary account was, a 12, 20, 6, 10, which is the new, right? One of them was the RDC, which was in there, which looked like it was grapevine...Something like that.	NULL
2438	But, there were also several other references to assets to locations that seemed to be where the primary account was 12, 20, 6, 10, and those locations didn't exist in the ice locations table. It almost sounds like those could be warehouses, but they didn't exist in the warehouse table.	NULL
2439	All right. Let me...  a Verizon call, and I don't know if I have all the emails that he had requested, all the special warehouses. Let me see if I can find that. Grapevine, and  , and there were a couple others. I think that...	NULL
2440	I've monopolized the time  , but I think that's pretty much all I had.	NULL
2441	We don't have to go into detail on this, but  said to try to work those shipments, and I don't know if you saw the email. Today at 11:00 AM Eastern Time. Would have been 10, 11. Go into it now,  .	NULL
2442	What is the problem of the shipment? What exactly was in the email? I can probably find it...	NULL
2443	The shipment of...	NULL
2444	Is this the one about the projects?	NULL
2445	You're cutting out. Or I am.	NULL
2446	Sorry.	NULL
2447	No, go ahead. You were cutting out, I couldn't hear.	NULL
2448	Is this the one about the projects being wrong on the shipments?	NULL
2449	Yeah.	NULL
2450	We were just looking at that before we got on the call with you guys, so I should be able to give you an update tomorrow once we finish looking at it.	NULL
2451	Thanks.	NULL
2452	Sure. Is there anything else?	NULL
2453	No, not here.	NULL
2454	No.	NULL
2455	All right. Thanks, everybody. We'll talk to you guys later.	NULL
2456	Thank you. Bye.	NULL
2457	DJ seems peppy.	NULL
2458	Is it her Friday, too?	NULL
2459	What am I working on today, the LCAM? What we'll be working on for the next meeting, the LCAM. What do I need from who? Nothing, issues,  can go away. Thanks.	NULL
2460	Been working on more of the elements and stuff. I've looked over Jasmine's page, and then I've been doing help file stuff for current notifying. What about you, Mahesh?	NULL
2461	I've been working on login page.	NULL
2462	Login page? What are you working on? Jasmine pretty much has it done.	NULL
2463	The same page. I'm working on whatever she's working on, business studio. It's different. I think I got the files from the notify library. They keep on changing them  .	NULL
2464	A little bit.	NULL
2465	A bit, so sometimes we  because what I am doing, is I am downloading from there and pasting on the desktop and working there. So the names, everything, is changing from  .	NULL
2466	That's annoying.	NULL
2467	I think the collaboration with Jasmine is not working as expected  . Today I can show you that.	NULL
2468	You really need to be working with someone else.	NULL
2469	I need to also be working on the changing of the icons for the notify  .	NULL
2470	For the tiles.	NULL
2471	We really need to set up a  repository or something that we can work from so that we're not running into these issues, and so that you're not working from your desktop and using old files.	NULL
2472	.	NULL
2473	Jasmine threw it all out to TFS i think, from the  . It's terrible.	NULL
2474	Is it in TFS now?	NULL
2475	I think so. I'm not 100 percent sure.	NULL
2476	But we still have the source code that needs to go in TFS?	NULL
2477	Yeah, we don't have that. I'm just talking about the stories. So you're talking about putting all of our files there?	NULL
2478	That would be good to do.	NULL
2479	Jasmine...	NULL
2480	Should be in charge of doing that...	NULL
2481	I just need a half hour with somebody to think about this because we're going to need to  . Probably enter  notify half. We're going to be on that, on that release cycle. There's going to be some issues with that when I start plugging-up the APIs. All that's under Titan.	NULL
2482	We don't want to make this a configuration nightmare for developers to go in.	NULL
2483	Who do you need to sit down with?	NULL
2484	Somebody.	NULL
2485	What is the question?	NULL
2486	It doesn't matter.	NULL
2487	I just need to bounce ideas off somebody.	NULL
2488	What are you talking about?	NULL
2489	Source control and putting everything in TFS. All of our files and everything. Right now, we're working off of  two, people are working on their desktop and files are getting written. We're not using the same stuff.	NULL
2490	Stuff is breaking. It shouldn't be.	NULL
2491	My note is, can we notify? We can probably add to the notify solution. We haven't had the solution upgraded since  the project  .	NULL
2492	You could probably cue Karen on this.  a release manager.	NULL
2493	I don't know who the release manager is.	NULL
2494	It needs one.	NULL
2495	Agreed.	NULL
2496	It needs to start getting on integrations and  . I need to show Karen what they did. Whether or not she's able to show up and put much into it and see.	NULL
2497	What is she working on?	NULL
2498	She's just finishing up with Peter's stuff, but she's also releasing  on that. I'm collecting  . She needs to be.	NULL
2499	OK.	NULL
2500	But, I guess  . Unless they hire somebody else. It doesn't need to be Susan.	NULL
2501	Like a project manager?	NULL
2502	Oh man, a release manager. It needs a release manager for  .	NULL
2503	.	NULL
2504	Whatever it needs.	NULL
2505	But we're not doing the  .	NULL
2506	I'm just saying somebody needs to be driving these releases and putting together iterations, because we've got to start getting results. We've got to start having iterations that have meat in them.	NULL
2507	I agree.	NULL
2508	Otherwise, we'll just keep floundering.	NULL
2509	Mahesh, what do you need? Need anything right now?	NULL
2510	No.	NULL
2511	So what do we have?	NULL
2512	.	NULL
2513	Login page and home screen.	NULL
2514	I'm bleeding, bro.	NULL
2515		NULL
2516		NULL
2517	Back when I lived here, that would never happen.	NULL
2518	Would have been real blood.	NULL
2519	.	NULL
2520	We need to have the login page link up with the home page.	NULL
2521	updating the icons for every page.So if I .	NULL
2522	That would be ideal, yes. That was what we wanted.	NULL
2523	OK all right back to work. I'll get Karen these.	NULL
2524	.	NULL
2525	This is my home page, so I need to...once I log in, I should be able to access  . This is for , so I need to change these icons. I need to change the  like this. . That's what I'm thinking, if I load this website with this login page, so I can easily change the icons.	NULL
2526	.	NULL
2527	.	NULL
2528	What did the login page  .	NULL
2529	something missing.	NULL
2530	So what did we decide about what links and things to put in there?	NULL
2531	Only the view training schedule is going to be available, but it's not showing up there.	NULL
2532	How did that end up?	NULL
2533	Darryl didn't want the training stuff to be available to users outside of being logged in, because he said that our competitors could just go and see what you could do with notify without...	NULL
2534	customers.	NULL
2535	He didn't want the help files available from the home page. Or from the login page, rather. Until you've logged in.	NULL
2536	I disagree with that.	NULL
2537	Why do you disagree with that?	NULL
2538	Because it's like a sales tool. Our competitors can get there if they want to get there.	NULL
2539	I guess they could just create a fake account.	NULL
2540	It's on there now.	NULL
2541	Yeah, but he wants it gone now.	NULL
2542	I'll have that discussion with him  .	NULL
2543		NULL
2544	It's fine. I'll talk to him.	NULL
2545	That probably needs to happen soon, because he was pretty adamant about it.	NULL
2546	I guess I'm project downer there, right?	NULL
2547	Yep.	NULL
2548	I'll have the discussion with him and then  . Ultimately it's, we can decide whether or not we want to do that. It's a landing page for something that people that are interested in knowing what it is will be going to.	NULL
2549	I mean, as far as we can...	NULL
2550	Freaking paranoia, worried about  .	NULL
2551	Couldn't somebody just register with a fake account and get all the information anyway?	NULL
2552	Not really. When they register their account, we give the company access. Then they have to register as part of the company. Until we say this company is there...Someone can go in and say, "I'm with one of these other companies."	NULL
2553	But if they don't have an email address matching the domain, then somebody from that company has to validate them. It's a little bit.	NULL
2554	OK.	NULL
2555	It may be that...Maybe we end up with a different link when you're not logged in. Even if you're a valid user, PHI doesn't want some competitor of theirs looking at their processes, but they want to be able to see them too.	NULL
2556	I see both sides of that. Whatever you want to do.	NULL
2557	You can put a link to our  .	NULL
2558	That's in the  embedded file. At the bottom it says powered by  . That's a link to one's home page. Maybe I can...	NULL
2559	I think  .	NULL
2560	It shouldn't fit. Adding a link to the home page is not a big deal. It's going to change everything to make  .	NULL
2561	It's planned to be in there.	NULL
2562	In two week  , we're supposed to have something published that you can actually log in.	NULL
2563	Login, see the home screen and then conversation page. Cool, cool, cool.	NULL
2564	That's good.	NULL
2565	What's going on with that?	NULL
2566	...or that is doesn't allow remote connections -- which I has up until now -- or that it can't connect to the server. What the heck?	NULL
2567	This computer may not have connectivity.	NULL
2568	. Susan? Anyone want to put board up?	NULL
2569	I can't get connected to my computer to get the board up.	NULL
2570	You can Google. You can Google.	NULL
2571	Well, my board's up.	NULL
2572	OK, well, call them out. What do they got  ?	NULL
2573	I'm inside updated  inventory search.	NULL
2574	Still working on that, Adam?	NULL
2575	I've worked on it a tiny bit yesterday.	NULL
2576	Most of you time was spent on...	NULL
2577	Other things, and including the remote. I had received messages are now coming in from  ...So, I had a bunch of those. This is  screen. I got it down, from 203, I got it down to 60, that they're going to have to look at.	F
2578	That's good. You got rid of the stuff that they need to be concerned about.	F
2579	Just as long as there's  have to see  , we can give them an update on that this morning. They need to look at those 60 that are left, because they can't  FTR serial numbers.  .	F
2580	Patrick, if you launch the  .	NULL
2581	before  follow it again, hours of testing   .	NULL
2582	Can we get it on the Internet at all?	NULL
2583	OK, Grady's got generate report data.	NULL
2584	I'm still working on that. I've got to update  out, and couldn't touch TFS. I'll update LCAM.	NULL
2585	Who's next?	NULL
2586	Kevin and Drake's got modify the retail notifications that handle non-sterilized equipment, and to modify received equipment that handle non-sterilized equipment.	F
2587	In theory,   this afternoon...	NULL
2588	I know, what's this "in theory" crap?	NULL
2589	So, you're making progress, though.	NULL
2590	Reboot.	NULL
2591	I don't have anything right now  , and Patrick has got break out bay audit details into their own page and grid.	NULL
2592	I'm plugging away at that.	NULL
2593	And add duplicate H  description for older, unprocessed  .	F
2594	Yeah, those are all bay audit screen updates. I'm shoveling through them at the moment.	A
2595	I swear, that's weird. Shut that...  that.	NULL
2596	And new  update.	NULL
2597	And Brian doesn't have anything?  He's afraid to try and break his stuff apart into tasks. I don't think he has any tasks out there, so they wouldn't show up on the board. He's being a bad boy  .	NULL
2598	And very silly.	NULL
2599	He's usually my good one. The one that puts the tasks out there   .	NULL
2600	"Brian's not doing anything!"	NULL
2601	Try it now, Susan.	NULL
2602	Don't think I'm  .	NULL
2603	I did want to bring up, while we're here...I keep looking up there for the time since it's not up. We do have some issues that probably are going to require a release to be fixed, so I don't know who has time to look at those issues  .	NULL
2604	Take the keyboard away from her!	NULL
2605	Apparently Brian does.	NULL
2606	Give them to Brian. He doesn't have a lot of work.	NULL
2607	Yeah, it's all Brian. I sent that email out this morning. I don't know if you looked at it yet. You know that issue where I said it was weird on those ZFR's? There were two audit trail records that flipped it back. It's also doing it when they manually edit stuff on the edit assets screen.	NULL
2608	Maybe I should have  these after all.	NULL
2609	That's a problem, because they're editing it, and they're changing values, and then we're going, "Nope!" And putting them right back.	F
2610	That's a problem, because they're editing it, and they're changing values, and then we're going, "Nope!" And putting them right back.	A
2611	That, to me, is a show-stopper type of an issue, even though the value is not horribly, horribly important. It's like parent amount position and parent  . Is this reverting back to amount position in a  in another location? And there was something else.	F
2612	Can I get rid of  ? So, I don't know. How do you all want to handle the things that are out there now that really need to be fixed? Because they don't have workarounds for them.	NULL
2613	Fix them?	NULL
2614	Who's going to do the fixing and not do their one  stuff, is my question?	NULL
2615	.	NULL
2616	your desktop.	NULL
2617	I didn't do anything on my desktop.	NULL
2618	...your desktop. Internet Explorer...	NULL
2619	Tuesday. It does its normal reboot during the week. Is it Wednesday morning you come in  ?	NULL
2620	Call  . That's what I do.	NULL
2621	I don't need to go to TBS now, I'm just going to go and pull up those emails that have those issues that we need to decide.	NULL
2622	Mailed all those  .com.	NULL
2623	Only three minutes, it's not worth it  .	NULL
2624	Do you have the master  for Frontier on the share site?	NULL
2625	It's not on the share site, right now, because I've been trying to get it updated, so, it's just on our local machine. I'll copy it out there and tell you where it is. I'm going to send it out when I get through it, if I can ever flipping get through with it, if they will quit sending emails.	NULL
2626	Actually, I'm cutting it off at this morning and trying to get the rest of them in there.	NULL
2627	Didn't you say  add it, it's 82, it's 85?	NULL
2628	Yep.  What can I say?	NULL
2629	My God.	NULL
2630	Frontier would like that list too, but I'm like, being selfish and holding it all to myself.	NULL
2631	What is the saying? People don't know what's going on, they freak out. People know that they're going to die at a certain time they're OK.	NULL
2632	Right! What is that phrase?	NULL
2633	I know all kind of phrases. I think you just made that up.	NULL
2634	You've never heard that phrase?	NULL
2635	No.	NULL
2636	That's true, I mean it's like the chaos. If people don't understand that there's chaos, they freak out. If people understand that it's chaos, and it's organized chaos, they're OK with it.	NULL
2637	I believe that.	NULL
2638	Are you saying me sending out the list is that we make it organized chaos?	NULL
2639	That's perfect. I know my issue has been recognized.	NULL
2640	Well, that's what I was trying to give them. It's like, I'm not ignoring these. I've got them on the list. Some of them I've got on the list because we still need to research them, because I don't know if they're an issue or not, or it's just something that they did wrong, then I need to tell them here's the correct way to do that.	NULL
2641	I dare you one day to just kind of add a fourth digit to it.	NULL
2642	1268  .	NULL
2643	frame.	NULL
2644	I was going to say like a million  73 years old.	NULL
2645	Even worse, really high. See if anybody notices. I might do that, now that you said that  . Whenever I get to the 90s, instead of it being issue number 90 it will be like 92.  Or something.	NULL
2646	700.	NULL
2647	Just start going backwards. This is issue number two on the list or make it three.	NULL
2648	In one of them I sent out, I don't remember if I left it or not, but I had put on there, that the issue number does not indicate priority,  because it doesn't. When I say it's issue number 88, that doesn't mean anything except that I have it on this list.	NULL
2649	When  will see that list to Jim and he'll go, "Um, well, uh,  90 or?"	NULL
2650	Welcome to the dark side, Kevin. Hold on, Jim's calling into the meeting here.	NULL
2651	I'm going to hang up on you and call in to the call.	NULL
2652	OK, be nice to Jim.	NULL
2653	He's throwing me under the bus now.	NULL
2654	You too.	NULL
2655	Bye.	NULL
2656	Bye.	NULL
2657	The three of us we're over to where we were.	NULL
2658	I don't have any, Grady.	NULL
2659	I wouldn't let you back, I'd  if you did.	NULL
2660	It's been too hot today for a sweater. Hi, who's on the call?	NULL
2661	Jim's on.	NULL
2662	Kathy Deacon.	NULL
2663	Cindy  .	NULL
2664	Do we have anything?	NULL
2665	Just a quick update on...	NULL
2666	Hi, who just joined?	NULL
2667	It's Kevin.	NULL
2668	Some of that may be fallout, some of it may not. I've spot-checked several other and they weren't fallout so far, so there's this new  to us. We need to figure out where that equipment's coming from or that  , may just be something we didn't have previously.	NULL
2669	It was not fallout, and it was not in the CL model. I know I spot-checked one yesterday. It was truly a  that we didn't receive from you all to import, and it didn't fallout, because we never received it. I don't know if they're all bad, but...	NULL
2670	They've replaced them with the new FTR one. I don't know if that's it. It's happened before, that they hire somebody new, they don't have the  receive  .	NULL
2671	Most of them are FTR-type hands	NULL
2672	That might be one reason, but we'll give you the official answer after we check.	NULL
2673	So far we've received about 203 Received Equipment and 60 of them fell out with Did Not  at this point.	NULL
2674	That was the only update we had for you all this morning. Do you all have anything for us?	NULL
2675	We're working on...Last night we were talking about the ship via CLLI codes, that starts with SA-type T  , the dimension was 500 some.	NULL
2676	We're working,  to see what would be a report that would be good for us to go through. We'll get that figured. Kim wanted to talk about those fallouts, try to do it as a group, so we're not having any conflicts. We can work definitely on that. I don't have anything else.	A
2677	We're working,  to see what would be a report that would be good for us to go through. We'll get that figured. Kim wanted to talk about those fallouts, try to do it as a group, so we're not having any conflicts. We can work definitely on that. I don't have anything else.	F
2678	Anybody else have anything?	NULL
2679	Susan, I sent you an email and got you  call.	NULL
2680	I probably haven't seen it. I have problems logging into my computer from the conference room this morning. If you sent it in the last 30 minutes, then I haven't seen it yet.	NULL
2681	I've got it, DJ. We don't have anything else, so wait for the other caller to go over it now.	NULL
2682	Is Drake with us?	NULL
2683	Are you asking if Drake is here? Yes, he's here.	NULL
2684	OK. We wanted to talk about two changes that were made to CTDI interface.	NULL
2685	Do we need to be here?	NULL
2686	You don't have to stay.	NULL
2687	We had some questions. We're trying to understand...Let me just pull it up.	NULL
2688	Can you see if Daryl is available?	NULL
2689	Yep.	NULL
2690	Yes.	NULL
2691	Correct? OK. The first one...I took notes, plus I double-checked the CTDI. We were under the impression, for those MRs, the finance issues and whatever the MR, that those could be worked through the existing code of send and receive. I was a little confused why that would be outside the scope.	NULL
2692	We hadn't decided. It could either be a service or a file, depending upon the size of that file, how much data...	NULL
2693	Were you sending it to them, or they were sending it to you?	NULL
2694	No, we were creating, depending on which way we were doing it. If we create a service, they would pull it whenever they wanted. If it was an FTP, then we would send it to them or put it on the FTP site, daily or however often it was run.	NULL
2695	To tackle the first one, first. You're saying that Mike suggested to use existing interfaces, is not appropriate or what...	NULL
2696	The existing interface doesn't change part numbers now. We would either have to change the existing interface to make it change part numbers -- which is not what the interface is designed for -- or we create a new interface to allow them to change part numbers. That's all they're doing with it.	NULL
2697	Either way, it'll be a change for us. It is not like we could just allow them to send it to the existing interface and it'll change the part with what they want.	NULL
2698	Wasn't that a two part thing? One with...	NULL
2699	Yeah, part or a serial number. VIN number.	NULL
2700	OK, but short of changing the part number, I thought the MR, the old part number would go out and the new one would come in.	NULL
2701	Yeah, that's...	NULL
2702	Would that really...?	NULL
2703	We seem to have one that's still bringing back in...	NULL
2704	We're just trying to make sure, before we accept the digital feed that.	NULL
2705	We still wouldn't change that.	NULL
2706	We might need an expert. We're a little confused.	NULL
2707	Their proposal was to send it out as one part number and then we would send another message, have it coming back in as a different part number. Still, the code doesn't change the part number when it comes in, it  that VIN and moves that VIN where it needs to be. It doesn't change the base equipment on that, that VIN.	F
2708	It wouldn't be treated like take the old one out and replace it with the new one?	NULL
2709	No. Basically it would  no change, the way they're saying to do it now. So like I said, it's either change that interface, or create a new interface.	NULL
2710	A new interface is safer. It's a safer way to do it.	NULL
2711	Yeah, because I don't think you want to change the part every time you get something in, because we wouldn't have any idea whether this was a part change or it's just receiving something in.	NULL
2712	I've got to see. Mike was thinking that those would be treated as two separate records. I hear what you're saying. We have a whole record leaving and a whole record coming in. To me, it would be changing the VIN.	NULL
2713	But you have to find it.	NULL
2714		NULL
2715	The other one,  would it be something we could do? Just run a query and let them pick it up? Isn't that all you're doing?	NULL
2716	Yeah.	NULL
2717	Have your part number and quantity. I just don't know why that would be such a significant code issue.	NULL
2718	We said it was three points.	NULL
2719	The whole thing?	NULL
2720	No. Three points for each of them. Don't look at me like that. I didn't make the query.	NULL
2721	I didn't make it either. I didn't make the query.	NULL
2722	until now.	NULL
2723	You can write, if you want to. Have Kim or Edward or someone write that query to do it, that's possible. Otherwise, like I said we create another service  or just sent it through with ITP.	NULL
2724	DJ, do we have enough for now? I guess I don't...	NULL
2725	Because we're not just pulling a query...	NULL
2726	...with what we do.	NULL
2727	On the second one, I think we talked about, you wouldn't want an audited adjustment anyway, right?	NULL
2728	Jim. Right.	NULL
2729	We want  .	NULL
2730	But second, yes, there is a discrepancy. We were going to keep that manual anyway, correct? I think even Mike agreed.	NULL
2731	That's our understanding right now, is that it would just be a...It's just a way of being right and doing corrections at this point. That would be manual.	NULL
2732	All right. I guess, DJ, we have enough to review our options and get back with them.	NULL
2733	So, just out of curiosity, Adam and Drake. Why was this outside the scope of the interface? We just didn't clarify it up front?	NULL
2734	It was never asked for up front.	NULL
2735	First time we heard of it was last week.	NULL
2736	Last week was the first we heard of it. We never anticipated it or coded for it.	NULL
2737	In snapshot? It's not a bad idea. It's a good idea. It's just that like I said, we did not anticipate it.	NULL
2738	All of this stuff takes time, and time is running short. We'd anticipated this much work to do, and then we get six more days worth of work tacked on to it, and we have to be done by next Friday.	NULL
2739	I got it.	NULL
2740	So,  we will discuss it and let him know.	NULL
2741	OK, thanks. We'll talk to you guys later.	NULL
2742	Bye.	NULL
2743	Bye.	NULL
2744	Exactly.	NULL
2745	It was 60 degrees in July.	NULL
2746	30 percent humidity.	NULL
2747	If the humidity wasn't so high, it wouldn't be as bad. I don't think so.	NULL
2748	We'll go ahead and get started. If  calls, he'd probably call me through the other terminal.	NULL
2749	Have you done any testing with CTDI yet, right? Are you all ready to test with CTDI? He's trying. He's calling again. I'm going to try this another way, Brian.	NULL
2750	OK.	NULL
2751	It keeps going back to you. Hold on. Hello?	NULL
2752	Hello. I thought you all died or something.	NULL
2753	No, now we're going to try...We didn't quite die. Now we're going to try...	NULL
2754	Nuclear bomb.	NULL
2755	So, Brian's on hold and I had  . If I hit conference now, and then go to Brian's, do you think it will work?	NULL
2756	Probably, it won't.	NULL
2757	We'll try it and see.	NULL
2758	You get them both on, we're going to have to call in to the other.	NULL
2759	Nah. That doesn't work. Let me try something else.	NULL
2760	OK.	NULL
2761	Wait, it keeps taking me back to you. Hold on.	NULL
2762	Do you see a "Join" button on there?	NULL
2763	I did. Let me go back.	NULL
2764	Did you hang up on Brian?	NULL
2765	No, I have Brian. Brian can you hear me?	NULL
2766	You still have me. I didn't hang up yet.	NULL
2767	OK. We still have  on hold. Hold on a second.	NULL
2768	Just in time for  .	NULL
2769	OK, who do I have on the call?	NULL
2770	You have Brian.	NULL
2771	Yay! It worked.	NULL
2772	Now, remember how you did it next time.	NULL
2773	Good luck with that.	NULL
2774	I'll have to hang up to call the other people, then.	NULL
2775	We have five minutes. We can do this in five minutes.	NULL
2776	I'm good. I'm doing clean up on back-taxes I have, here. I'm good.	NULL
2777	Which one?	NULL
2778	Don't know, the  . I'm just doing a mix...Bulk coding complete. I'm just doing.	NULL
2779	This one?	NULL
2780	Yeah.	NULL
2781	OK. You didn't finish it Friday? You didn't find your two hours?	NULL
2782	Couldn't find my two...Well, I got everything, the bulk of it done. I've got to make sure everything still works like it's supposed to.	NULL
2783	Once you're done with that, are you done with your stories, except for the testing?	NULL
2784	I think so.	NULL
2785	That's encouraging. Grady, you're done with all of your stories, right?	NULL
2786	When you want another one, we'll build.	NULL
2787	Whenever he gets done with this stuff. Drake?   . Working on the warehouse interface for non-serialized assets?	NULL
2788	Yes.	NULL
2789	That has to be done before you all can do testing with CTDI.	NULL
2790	Sure enough.	NULL
2791	When's that going to be done?	NULL
2792	Late Friday afternoon.	NULL
2793	Late Friday afternoon. Not awesome.	NULL
2794	In theory I could finish that today.	NULL
2795	That'd be good, because that's really the only thing that's holding up testing with CTDI. And we'll have a call with them tomorrow, at which time, hopefully we'll say we're ready to do testing, because seriously, I don't want to be doing testing next week when you all aren't here.	NULL
2796	It still needs work, though. It's going to work, though.	NULL
2797	Sure. Like the last interface worked.	NULL
2798	It did! It worked.	NULL
2799	Eventually. I mean, your stuff worked to begin with, and then...	NULL
2800	How's your stuff coming, Patrick?	NULL
2801	It's coming along. I got the second page, there. I'm getting all the old icons put on there, and after that is multi head, so, it's coming. It's got  , I think.	NULL
2802	Awesome.	NULL
2803	Brian, I don't have your name on here, so you never added any tasks for yours?	NULL
2804	No.	NULL
2805	He just didn't have anything to do.	NULL
2806	How's your stuff coming? I know there's been several emails going back and forth.	NULL
2807	Still got about 200 locations, so there's only one  . We still have  from the previous two versions released, to do some debugging and . It's not all of their pseudos ship-to codes.  pseudos.	NULL
2808	He did say that.	NULL
2809	So, I'm trying to work it out.	NULL
2810	Oh, and just let them go through without an address?	NULL
2811	Yeah. Exactly.	NULL
2812	For the pseudos.	NULL
2813	pseudo code.	NULL
2814	There's about 20,000 assets that reference locations...Well, no, actually, there's about 20,000 locations referenced by assets that don't exist in every location.  , so it's interesting. But anyway, so, we're working on locations.	NULL
2815	OK. We're going to have to hang up in a minute, but I do want to bring up...Who's doing the parts that aren't conversion for  ?	NULL
2816	We haven't worked at our conversions.	NULL
2817	Why? Are you restoring the database backup there, Brian, once you've done your stuff?	NULL
2818	I guess I can. We don't have to talk about that now, though.	NULL
2819	We don't. We've got to get off this call. My only concern is, Grady's on vacation next week and we're supposed to be doing this next Sunday, which, by the way, you and I need to get together and give them some kind of a, "Yeah, you're going to be able to start work on Tuesday at name and date."	NULL
2820	So, that's not this Sunday, but next Sunday.	NULL
2821	That's correct. A week from Sunday, but because Grady's not going to be here next week, that's what made me think about...We've got to get all our ducks in a row so we know who's doing what, and who's needs to be available on that Sunday. Or if anybody needs to be available on Sunday. They might be able to come in Monday morning and do stuff. All right. It's 9:30. We'll hang up on you guys and call them.	NULL
2822	All right.	NULL
2823	Thanks, bye.	NULL
2824	Please enter your PIN.	NULL
2825	Hi. Who's on the call?	NULL
2826	Jim's on.	NULL
2827	Hey Jim.	NULL
2828	here.	NULL
2829	Hi,  .	NULL
2830	DJ's on.	NULL
2831	Hey DJ.	NULL
2832	Do you know  ?	NULL
2833	Hi. Who just joined?	NULL
2834	This is Brian.	NULL
2835	Hey Brian.	NULL
2836	Kevin.	NULL
2837	Kevin.	NULL
2838	I don't have anything on my list for Frontier this morning. Brian, did you have anything that we needed to ask them on this call, or do we need another call to talk about conversion?	NULL
2839	This might be a two-minute question, so I think there was about, let me look real quick, it will take me a few seconds to get it up. I may need a couple more seconds.	NULL
2840	Kevin. As we got back to the source, I guess I don't remember a pseudo ever being used. Do you?  make the request. I guess I'm leaning towards the...	NULL
2841	I'm shipping to a pseudo?	NULL
2842	Is that what Brian was talking about? The via  location.	NULL
2843	Yeah. I'm not aware of shipping to a pseudo, so I can treat those similarly to the way that we're treating the ones that we know how to ship to, information, but we don't have it, and I can put ship unknown on the via location.	NULL
2844	That way somebody can go in there and prioritize whether or not  to that direct location or somewhere else.	NULL
2845	If that's OK with you guys  , so I need to send that out to the group, so it's going to be shipped unknown all together...	NULL
2846	I owe you guys an email explaining that, so I'll send that to you, and you can  to whoever you need to. I'll explain the pseudo exchange  to  . OK? .	F
2847	I don't think we had anything else for you all this morning. Do you all have anything for us that we need to discuss?	NULL
2848	Brian, I've got here, I think he deciphered these Verizon three warehouses, but I'll double check and  arrange to send something. I know they went back and forth a few times. It would be the  as far as what they're taking in to the setting, so I'll get back with you on that.	NULL
2849	One urgent thing we have is Brenda's  back in my group. I don't know if Adam's on.	NULL
2850	We can't make them send...	NULL
2851	So you're saying that you've received new equipment  by looking at the wires? By wired information? But you haven't seen any of that evidence in LCAM, is that right?	A
2852	So you're saying that you've received new equipment  by looking at the wires? By wired information? But you haven't seen any of that evidence in LCAM, is that right?	F
2853	Correct.  .	NULL
2854	It's still the same situation I reported last time. At this point, I haven't received any interface messages that indicate new equipment. I sent that message to Ron to get an update on when we would be receiving those, but I haven't received any contact back regarding new equipment.	NULL
2855	I'm going to check with them and see if that's something we're missing here. Because it's new, it's coming direct from the vendor, they would place the unique bar code  they had it in, so I would assume  pulled it out of...	NULL
2856	He'll pull it out wired, and we'll see how he does this. Check with the original PO to make sure they're all received, which normally isn't...We'll check on it.	NULL
2857	You'll let us know what Ron says?	NULL
2858	Yeah.	NULL
2859	Thanks.	NULL
2860	That's all I had.  , go ahead.	NULL
2861	The only thing I had, I asked Drake for some of that information about moving databases. I'll take a look at that later today, and let you know if it works.	NULL
2862	Nobody else had anything?	NULL
2863	All Right. Thanks everybody. We'll talk to you guys later.	NULL
2864	.	NULL
2865	I thought Ron said he was going to call back  .	NULL
2866	.	NULL
2867	Everything...	NULL
2868	We do have a meeting with John about it. Really nothing, just get over there and...	NULL
2869	What they made John the offers to give...heads up?	NULL
2870	Much bigger issues regarding Windows 10, the hardware aspects of this. What kind of hardware we'll keep it on, Support, or  for support, all that logistics part of it.	NULL
2871	Software side, Michael said he's got some kinks he's got to work on the entire map server stuff. Do some research for Windows 10, see if all hope is lost. We're fixing an issue that's not even compatible on this version, so that's very frustrating.	NULL
2872	That's pretty much it. I will talk to Michael a little bit later to see...he's researching a program to replace IIS.  It's really fun. As soon as he lets me know...I'm just really curious if it's going to work on your computer or not.	NULL
2873	OK, since...	NULL
2874		NULL
2875	It was an expensive trip.	NULL
2876		NULL
2877	I'm sure he said that about me, because I have three cars,  and there's only two of us living at home, so I don't care.	NULL
2878	But they're all, I mean your Acura...	NULL
2879	A banker sold it finally. That was when we had four.	NULL
2880	That was when you had four?	NULL
2881	Counting Bobby's work car, five.  I'm not counting his when I say we have three. We have four.	NULL
2882	So you're the reason why there's global warming. I see how it is.	NULL
2883	I only drive like ten miles a day.	NULL
2884	Well, she doesn't drive them all all at once.	NULL
2885	Hello.	NULL
2886	Hello	NULL
2887	That is a loud  .	NULL
2888	Hang on, I've got to go put you on mute for a minute.	NULL
2889	OK.	NULL
2890	That is a loud phone.	NULL
2891	What? I'm deaf now. I can't hear anything.	NULL
2892		NULL
2893	He must have a desk phone and a cell phone.	NULL
2894	I'm sorry.	NULL
2895	That's OK.	NULL
2896	Did you  on my ticket?	NULL
2897		NULL
2898	So testing with CT  . I know you did that yesterday. We haven't heard anything back from them.	NULL
2899	They sent out an email late yesterday, and I checked on them...	NULL
2900	We haven't heard anything since you checked.	NULL
2901	Not since my reply to that, no.	NULL
2902	Actually,  . So, this report?	NULL
2903	Oh, there's the mouse cursor.  the mouse cursor. I think I'm close to getting it fixed. I should finish it today. Null and blank  have been my enemy.	A
2904	Oh, there's the mouse cursor.  the mouse cursor. I think I'm close to getting it fixed. I should finish it today. Null and blank  have been my enemy.	F
2905	Everybody's enemy  sequel.	NULL
2906		NULL
2907	Do we have anything for them other than...	NULL
2908	Help.	NULL
2909	Can we  finalized spreadsheet of users so we can go ahead and import them?	NULL
2910	Yeah.	NULL
2911	If somebody wants to do that for me, that would help me out.	NULL
2912	That won't be me, so he's asking the two of y'all if y'all have time to import users into  .	NULL
2913	OK, send it normally.	NULL
2914	Beat you to it.	NULL
2915	Rock, paper, scissors?	NULL
2916	A warehouse full of hungry children to feed come Monday, so...	NULL
2917	What's going on with DC three?	NULL
2918	Barry is sending four people to Conyers, Georgia to inventory a warehouse full of test equipment.	NULL
2919	They're going to put acid tags on all of them, one location they have a list of what they think is in there. The other location they don't have anything. In the process of taking a copy of a wireless code, Carol's project, stripping out all the weird accounting stuff they have in there, and they're going to use that as a code base  .	NULL
2920		NULL
2921	I've got some ideas, but I want to run it past you three real quick.	NULL
2922	All right.	NULL
2923	Sorry.	NULL
2924	We have fan mail that we need to go over. I have not created iterations for this release, so this is...Contact switch  .	NULL
2925	We're going to take a deep breath. We're going to  now.	NULL
2926	, bring that around.	NULL
2927	Nobody has added any tasks, like I asked you to, right  ?	NULL
2928	Been busy with the other context, Frontier.	NULL
2929	Yes, as we all are. All right, so we said this would be...	NULL
2930	At least four  . I haven't had a chance to read it in its entirety, so, a little bit  .	NULL
2931	Took you about five days, max.	NULL
2932	An hour?	NULL
2933	Yeah.	NULL
2934	I thought I hit tab, but apparently, I didn't.	NULL
2935	Is that  somewhere?	NULL
2936	Yeah.	NULL
2937	So, testing it is what's going to take a minute, right? Because it's the...	NULL
2938	hour.	NULL
2939	The invoice  . This is a pre-defined query.	NULL
2940	It's not a repair PO.  we not  POs.  .	NULL
2941	things   .	NULL
2942	will take the longest, say, one hour. Half hour, rather.	NULL
2943	You all do stuff in half hour increments? I don't remember seeing that.	NULL
2944	I've been doing it so much lately that I gave Jesse the SQL to do it with.	NULL
2945	I was about to say, I'm sure she already had the SQL.	NULL
2946	Yeah. I've had  .  the screen.	NULL
2947	Yeah, he's like our build manager or whatever.	NULL
2948	What's the guy's name, at Frontier?	NULL
2949	Regna. R-E-G-N-A.	NULL
2950	Oh, OK.	NULL
2951	Regna?	NULL
2952	It's spelled R-E-G-N-A, but they say it like Renga, is how he pronounces it, but it's spelled R-E-G-N-A, so I don't know where it's from, to be pronounced that way. I don't know now.	NULL
2953	I don't know what it takes, if it's just on the screen, or if you have to do other stuff.	NULL
2954	I think Grady just does  . Trigger  all those  procedures out of the way. You've got  level, you've got...What is that? Table? I forgot the name of that table. Let's just say two hours. What do you think,  ?	NULL
2955	three hours.	NULL
2956	Three. I'm thinking optimistically.	NULL
2957	.	NULL
2958	He's saying three, I'm thinking two. I'm trying to be very optimistic.	NULL
2959	you call   .	NULL
2960	Allowing them to search by receive dates. I think receive date is already displaying on the screen. We just don't allow them to search by it. I'm not sure if you need to bring it up. Because I don't know if anybody  or not.	A
2961	Allowing them to search by receive dates. I think receive date is already displaying on the screen. We just don't allow them to search by it. I'm not sure if you need to bring it up. Because I don't know if anybody  or not.	F
2962	Can we search by create date?	NULL
2963	You can search by all kinds of stuff, so search...	NULL
2964	It's a bunch of stuff.  .	NULL
2965	There's start and end date. You start  .	NULL
2966	I do a  control   if...	NULL
2967	Yes,  than that.	NULL
2968	Right.	NULL
2969	That was cable putting it in there.  we tell them what we want.	NULL
2970	...that one started  four.	NULL
2971	conditional  procedure on the  prepared   .	NULL
2972	You want to be able...	NULL
2973	Yeah. So, just here it needs to be.	NULL
2974	So it's adding a column on it.	NULL
2975	He's talk about this. So, that's adding the column I asked you for.	NULL
2976	I got a chance to  procedure, change the grid, pull the code behind the scenes maybe add, what is it? Create date? Receive date. Add receive date to procedure results. It's like there's going to be two tabs. I did one tab...	NULL
2977	One for the grid.	NULL
2978	So the grid is.	NULL
2979	That's it. That won't take long. Probably about, I'll say one hour. It's not going to be that hard, really, once I get the stored procedure done.	NULL
2980	another task.	NULL
2981	Yeah, the other task would...To procedure results set.	NULL
2982		NULL
2983	And then  procedure.	NULL
2984	And you can update these.	NULL
2985	Yeah, I was about to say...	NULL
2986	Estimate for those?	NULL
2987	Go with one hour.	NULL
2988	You're good?	NULL
2989	Yeah. That'll be the easy one.	NULL
2990	All right.	NULL
2991	sort   .	NULL
2992	If we go and look at  that.	NULL
2993	No, it's here.  .	NULL
2994		NULL
2995	So right now, see  group is not on here, so that's what you're doing. You're adding  group, and it'll still have all the same information. It'll still have each of the  listed out under it.	F
2996	Another column.	NULL
2997	Well, it's however you want to do it. They would like it with  order, so yeah, you can do it as just another column on the report, as long as  would be duplicated. And that's kind of how it sounds like they want it, as opposed to having it as a header child grid, because then they can look at everything.	A
2998	Well, it's however you want to do it. They would like it with  order, so yeah, you can do it as just another column on the report, as long as  would be duplicated. And that's kind of how it sounds like they want it, as opposed to having it as a header child grid, because then they can look at everything.	F
2999	database....	NULL
3000	Stored proc.	NULL
3001	I would say stored proc  may be returned already, I don't know.  , I'm not familiar with that procedure, so it may be returned.	NULL
3002	For them.	NULL
3003	OK.  one hour, at most.	NULL
3004	Hello?	NULL
3005	That's  test.  code  . I finally say  , and it's only a one day story, so.	NULL
3006	page break	NULL
3007	If you want to make it...I don't care.	NULL
3008	Just say one. I'll review it before I start anything, and let you know.	NULL
3009	There are three that are related. There's this one, there's this one, and there's this one, and they're all related. Right now, if I go to...	NULL
3010	That's outside.	NULL
3011	out.	NULL
3012	search...	NULL
3013	has to say.	NULL
3014	Do a search these, and I'll select some, and I'd better  hardware. So, that's the first thing that you're changing. You're going to allow them to change the frame for bugs. So, that's one of these, and then once you do that...	NULL
3015	.	NULL
3016	Change the  , pull it  .	NULL
3017	That's one of them. Then, the other thing is, if you do this and you do print update...So, when you do this...No, it's not print update, is it? Try and update...	NULL
3018	You have to go back.	NULL
3019	So, the other thing is, when you do a journal change for hardwire, you have to enter an estimate. If you do a journal change and it's non-hardwire, you don't have to enter an estimate.	NULL
3020	So, it shows up here, but it's not required, but that's what you're going to do, is either make it required or default it for the  records.	NULL
3021	The other change is to allow them to make, let me see, what does it say? On here, they search for assets, and then they're going to change a whole group of hardwire and plugin records at the same time. Right now they can't do that, so that's the first change you're making. That's the story.	F
3022	Change the framework plugs.	NULL
3023	The other thing that they're doing is change multiple frame ID's and put a  in them, so this is the one...Search assets and then just pick a frame...	F
3024	So, it's different CLLIs. So, if I say I want to do these different CLLIs and I want to update the frame, because you can't. So, this story is to not throw that error message, so that they can update frames across CLLIs.	F
3025	frame  to do   customers.	NULL
3026	The change here is to put estimate on here. So, the story is...Why does it say  ?	NULL
3027	So, what they do today, the reason they want this, is they go in and they select plugs and hardwire combined, and they retire them. When they retire them, they go over to  , and when they go to  , they have to have an estimate on them.	A
3028	Estimate?	NULL
3029	I mean for the estimate. It's defaulting it to something. But for hardwire, it requires them to enter one, so the change is to put it on here, and if they enter one, use the one they enter. If they don't enter one, still use the default, like it's doing today.	NULL
3030	But that would only apply to hardwire.	NULL
3031	No, plugs. This only applies to plugs. If I went back and do a hardwire, then it'll have estimate through here.	NULL
3032	If you've got a group of hardwire and plugs, you've got to require the estimate  . If you only had plugs, your estimate is not required, and you use the default.	NULL
3033	...but what if they choose...	NULL
3034	So here's the hardwire. Here is what it looks for hardwire. So, you're going to make the same, regardless of whether it's hardwire or plug. It's always going to have this up here.	NULL
3035	When you were selecting the assets, did you choose just hardwire?	NULL
3036	That time I did.	NULL
3037	But you could choose hardwire and plug.	NULL
3038	The previous time I only picked plugs. That's why I didn't show the estimate.	NULL
3039	But it could have chose hardwire and plug, right?	NULL
3040	That's what they want to do.	NULL
3041	I'm thinking that scenario. That choose hardwire and plug. I'll put the estimate field up here, which, we want that now...	NULL
3042	They have to have it for hardwire.	NULL
3043	They have to have it for hardwire, but they don't need it for plugs, so if they put a value in here that's only applicable for hardwire...	NULL
3044	No.	NULL
3045	No.	NULL
3046	Oh, it applies to plugs too.	NULL
3047	Yes. What you're doing is, you're changing it so that when they select, regardless, you're going to have estimate show up here.	NULL
3048	Whatever they...	NULL
3049	If everything in their result set is plugs, and they don't enter an estimate in it, and they hit save...	NULL
3050	It goes to default.	NULL
3051	You're going to go with the default. If they've entered any hardwire in their result set, you're going to force them to put an estimate. Then, you're going to use that estimate for everything in that result set when you retire it.	NULL
3052	That'd be all hardwire, or hardwire and plug?	NULL
3053	That's right. You're not going to require it for plugs if it's only plugs, which you would still  .	NULL
3054	That's why I'm trying to...	NULL
3055	You think you're clear upon that now?  The reason I'm showing them all, because they're all interrelated. They're all...	NULL
3056	It's like you've got to get past this one, to get past that one, to get this one.	NULL
3057	Yeah.  every  When it's only in the frame it's an estimate.	NULL
3058	.	NULL
3059	Well...	NULL
3060	OK, well. Estimate.	NULL
3061	. What do you think,   ?	NULL
3062	This one's three days. That's what we estimated, this specific one.	NULL
3063	I think...	NULL
3064	Sure this is your work  ?	NULL
3065	for the day. Hardwire screen has  this is not need to have a frame if it's plugged  these guys, possibly   . Crap. This is a different one.	NULL
3066	Let's try it again.	NULL
3067	.	NULL
3068	I'm confused a little bit.	NULL
3069	I can't imagine when. This one is, they're reverse retiring.  . They're writing assets into the 1220 account. That's why it's this many days. Today, if they go...That actually   , can they do this? Search in assets and reverse retirement of 1220.	NULL
3070	Go back to the story.	NULL
3071	Today they reverse retire and then transfer to 1220. Step one is reverse retiring and transfer to 1220. Then, step two is updating the frame.	NULL
3072	On this screen for reverse retire, this what we want.	NULL
3073	So I can search assets that are retired and reverse retire some.	NULL
3074	Does it matter which ones?	NULL
3075	Start with a plug. Start with a plug and try a frame.	NULL
3076	It's all the way out here.	NULL
3077	Why?  some of these are probably  .	NULL
3078	Or CPR has a  .	NULL
3079	I hate that. I want to reverse retire. Really?	NULL
3080	Yeah. You can't retire one  . That's why I've always been  .	NULL
3081	retirement   .	NULL
3082	Shouldn't be. Have you searched for...?	NULL
3083	I searched for retire.	NULL
3084	Did a look up on the CLLI.	NULL
3085	On what CLLI  ?	NULL
3086	Search.	NULL
3087	Back here, when I had retire up there  .  . Those are both plugs. Reverse retire, and instead of in-service they're reverse retiring the inventory  .	NULL
3088	.	NULL
3089	Right here. We'll put a frame on here.	NULL
3090	Is inventory  you use?	NULL
3091	That's what they're doing, but...	NULL
3092	Would it be a  , either case?	NULL
3093	You're going to have it up there for either case.	NULL
3094	What they're literally doing is this. That's how I'll test it.	NULL
3095	Search for hardwire, its retiring place.	NULL
3096	Put the CPR in.	NULL
3097	?	NULL
3098	Yeah.	NULL
3099	. Then reverse retire this one.	NULL
3100	.	NULL
3101	Hardwire only.	NULL
3102	No, these are showing you,  , because it's going to be the same thing as what...	NULL
3103	It doesn't show a plug, it messes with your hardwire.	NULL
3104	When it's retired in place you have these options, to change, and the location...	NULL
3105	You can make an inventory of  and put in your estimate, and then put it in a frame.	NULL
3106	That's what frames are. You're on that string, it's just not visible for plugs.	NULL
3107	Would you make everything the same, make it work the same for plugs and for hardwire?	NULL
3108	Except...	NULL
3109	There a danger in doing that?	NULL
3110	Would they need the information for plugs?	NULL
3111	I would prefer it to be consistent if we can make it consistent. It makes it easier, whether they use it or not, as long as it does work if they do choose to use it. It isn't required if they don't choose to use  it. If I try to save this now, it's going to tell me something, estimate is required or something.	NULL
3112	Sure, no problem.  .	NULL
3113	Right now, none of these are required. Even if he made this the same screen for plugs...I didn't try and save all four. We could try and save, but it's probably the same thing. They probably require...Note was there, it was status and note, that was all that was showing up.	NULL
3114	I don't know if they want the ability to reverse retire and transfer plugs.	NULL
3115	They do, because that's what they said.	NULL
3116	Then, if that's the case...	NULL
3117	...it's a two-step where they're transferring, reverse retiring them and transferring them, and then they have to go in that big screen. They want it to be a one-step where they can update the frame.	NULL
3118	They hardwire this...	NULL
3119	...but the plug is not...?	NULL
3120	Yeah. Today, for hardwire the screen has frame, but for plugs it does not.	NULL
3121	Got you.	NULL
3122	That's what I'm saying. We should make it exactly the same, unless it's going to break something down the road in LCAM.	NULL
3123	I may need some stuff,  the changes that you have to make.	NULL
3124	We estimated at three days. Part of that being because even though we don't have to change Dopak for this we have to test Dopak to make sure it didn't break. This change would write a Dopak record. It shouldn't affect Dopak records. Look at you.	NULL
3125	That's OK, you've got Dopak as your story  .	NULL
3126	any specific code for it?	NULL
3127	You probably...	NULL
3128	...transfer?	NULL
3129	Yeah, you probably want a note to check the Dopak code for this. If nothing else to, during your test, to verify that Dopak is working as expected. If you need help with that, let me know. I'll sit down and we'll create some scenarios where I know what the Dopak  records should be, and we can make sure that they are that.	NULL
3130	I'll have to do that anyway.	NULL
3131	Whoa  .	NULL
3132	I have to do that anyway, for my tests.	NULL
3133	.	NULL
3134	That's this three-day story.	NULL
3135	It's week three now.	NULL
3136	I know, but what are your tasks  ? Do you want me to make one, and you can go off and research this?	NULL
3137	Probably have to, because I don't know if it's...Quite sure it's going to be UI, but  . I don't know if anything about  database will be required.	NULL
3138	I'll put that  on there for now. Then...	NULL
3139	Put three, and I'll divvy it up after I get another task. This is a three-day, right?	NULL
3140	Yeah.	NULL
3141	Do that, and if I have to bring another check I'll divvy...	NULL
3142	.	NULL
3143	18.	NULL
3144	18,  .	NULL
3145	I'm doing it  . It should be...	NULL
3146	Hours.	NULL
3147	Development hours, which aren't full days. That's at least got a task on there...	NULL
3148	For that end, and the other one's...	NULL
3149	. This is the one I showed you.	NULL
3150	You already went over that.	NULL
3151	Yeah. When you search, and you try and change multiple frames, it gives you an error message. It has to be for that. Is it as simple as error  ?	NULL
3152	I don't know. I'm not familiar with this section of code.	NULL
3153	You have to change...	NULL
3154	Yeah. Say to be determined, right now, and I'll fill them in as I learn more.	NULL
3155	Look at that. This is sad.	NULL
3156	three, I think?	NULL
3157	in there.   six on that, then since it's only...	NULL
3158	Sure.	NULL
3159	Once you look at it, if it's  you change them. That's that one.	NULL
3160	If it's going to be database also, I'd take a  and set a task for that.	NULL
3161	This is the...	NULL
3162	Of course it's not.	NULL
3163	This is a journal update. This is similar to frames. It's a frame update but it's a journal change.	NULL
3164	Don't  .	NULL
3165	Well, let me see if I know what you're talking about. I'm not at all sure. Have I found hardwire? That hardwire? Partially found. That's a hardwire, right?	NULL
3166	No, second character.	NULL
3167	Dang it. I thought it starts with a five. No, it's 0, 5.	NULL
3168	No, that's the second character.	NULL
3169	Zero five.  .	NULL
3170	I don't just want  though, I want both. I don't think I'm going to get those. First 1,000 are apparently all we use. What can I  ?	NULL
3171	Well you know you've have  .	NULL
3172	that's going to be a problem, it's going to be a problem. Anyways, if I'm trying to change   .	NULL
3173	.	NULL
3174	It's required for hardwire defaults for plug, but you cannot update plugs in hardwire in the same transaction. So, the code changes to allow it to be  transaction.	NULL
3175	Use the,  place that they use?	NULL
3176	The Data Garage?	NULL
3177	. The outside vendor they use. Industrial Movers?	NULL
3178	Industrial Movers. I-N-D dash something.	NULL
3179	It's underscore. IND_Movers, something like...	NULL
3180	I thought it was a dash  .	NULL
3181	It could be a dash.	NULL
3182	That's what I'm thinking. IND-Movers. Industrial-Movers.	NULL
3183	Both wrong  .	NULL
3184	At least I was right on the dash  .	NULL
3185	I knew it started with IND.	NULL
3186	that's hard wire but what's one six?	NULL
3187	I can't remember the other rules.  .	NULL
3188	How can I narrow it down to this? I have to go trough 834 records.	NULL
3189	Go to a different page. Grab one of those.	NULL
3190	OK, so just click. These are both plugs, and then go here. Zero, five.  all of them.	NULL
3191	.	NULL
3192	I know. That's why I said wait.	NULL
3193	Remove frame  edits.  .	NULL
3194	.	NULL
3195	.	NULL
3196	for hardware  for flow, even though   hardwire on the same transaction.	NULL
3197	What's that do? Frame  .	NULL
3198	Probably nothing because, like I said, Kate  these and confused the heck out of me. I tried to go back and clean them up.	NULL
3199	So it'll really remove estimate in it?	NULL
3200	best. Go back and read...	NULL
3201	You can't read what he put in here.  And you can't read what I put in here, because it won't, well, he put it in here but it's too big.	NULL
3202	OK, LCAM...	NULL
3203	.	NULL
3204	This one is supposed to be the one. You do a general change. It doesn't know what day you're referring to. You have to go back in and change the frame.	NULL
3205	?	NULL
3206	Yep. I put this stuff in here and he still didn't run the  right, but you can't really blame him because I've done diddly-squat, too.	NULL
3207	All right, that's what we're doing. Not all the rest of the stuff the way  words it. I've told you that. I don't word it like they do. I word it so I know what I'm doing.	NULL
3208	I thought printing wouldn't  .	NULL
3209	Not on the journal change. Estimate is, but  isn't. So, that's what this change is, which it only took us 45 minutes to get there.	NULL
3210	We estimated that, that one was three? How did we estimate that at three? Wait, this was on 45. That may not be three, because he also did not put any of the estimates on there. He did estimate that at three. Why is it three? What else has to happen? Because these are our estimates.	NULL
3211	I don't know. It's, if you're changing the frame it can't be general.	NULL
3212	Yeah, but this is general change. One of them was general change and one of them was that change the frame.	NULL
3213	On that screen you've got a drop down of general and non-general.	NULL
3214	No, I went to general change. I said I was going to general change it.  .	NULL
3215	I wouldn't change it.	NULL
3216	We used to.	NULL
3217	OK, you're on general change. You can't change the frame for hardware but you can't plug, right?	NULL
3218	No.	NULL
3219	The other way around?	NULL
3220	No.	NULL
3221	In other words, the thing  .	NULL
3222	Yeah. When you do a general change on an asset, it doesn't allow  , so you have to go up in and change the frame. Correct.	NULL
3223	It's basically this frame is not a general,  general  . In other words, if you go in and say the only thing you want to do is change the frame and you went to this screen  general change. That's what  when you're changing the frame. You're just changing the frame.	NULL
3224	Right. On this screen, if they come in and already change on here, the frame then you would throw and error message and tell them, frame those dates are not a general change. You would require one of these other fields to be changed at that point.	NULL
3225	The frame by itself...	NULL
3226	Right. You would not allow frame by themselves. I still don't know why we did it at three days, but that's OK. It's what they said they'd pay for.  I just don't know why. So annoying  .	NULL
3227	Frame  .	NULL
3228	Maybe we weren't sure how it might effect Dopak?	NULL
3229	I don't know.	NULL
3230	...something you don't do it for six months?	NULL
3231	General change probably doesn't even take frame as the parameters.  .	NULL
3232	He's going to have to...Is this store proc?	NULL
3233	You wanted workflow, change  .	NULL
3234	for frame to be a valid general   .	NULL
3235	This is probably the biggest part of this, right? The UI changes and then he has these backend changes. It's going to be two tasks.  .	NULL
3236	.	NULL
3237	frame entered  value  . Does that make any sense to you?   I'm trying to get something in here.	NULL
3238	When I figure some out some out, I'll talk to you.	NULL
3239	What do you think? Another day, or...Honestly?	NULL
3240	UI  procedures   .	NULL
3241	If you need to add another patch to this or a update the  on here. This got that one.	NULL
3242	that one. I was trying to make sure I wasn't   . This is the one that's really...	NULL
3243	There's two areas, I hope, I don't have a  Microsoft reports.	NULL
3244	Do you want two of that?	NULL
3245	Yeah, give me two because one's going to be in Microsoft reports and the other's going to be the  keep track of.	NULL
3246	So, Microsoft Report?	NULL
3247	Let's split the day four and four.	NULL
3248	It's three and three.	NULL
3249	It's much like a cup of coffee is six ounces but actually a cup, liquid cup, is eight ounces.	NULL
3250	Part of that day is mine. Part of that day is all of this crap.	NULL
3251	OK, three and three. Who decided a cup of coffee was six ounces instead of eight?	NULL
3252	Part of Bartender.	NULL
3253	Bartender files. There is one extra barcode next to existing data.  .	NULL
3254	Says 23 of them.	NULL
3255	I've already got the data in place?	NULL
3256	Yeah, the data's there it just doesn't have a barcode on it.	NULL
3257	Bartender won't be a big issue. It's Microsoft Reports. I have to generate the barcode images to the report. Yeah, I think three and three will be fine.	NULL
3258	OK, Jerry this one's yours. Let me see what I say about this. This is 160.	NULL
3259	are too strict?	NULL
3260	Quest is to be able to retire hardware equipment that's inventory  for the  without having to move the equipment to in service. In service Dopak records are attached.	NULL
3261	What?	NULL
3262	retire. I thought retire hardwire that's inventory.	NULL
3263	Right now you cannot retire inventory  equipment. You have to move it to in service and then retire it. This one I remember, because I asked him about this 166. I sent him a bazillion emails on it. I remember, when I finally understood it. It makes perfect sense...	NULL
3264	357 X   . It's just a number.	NULL
3265	Dopak records.	NULL
3266	records   .	NULL
3267	Yeah, he made them 357. She made them all 357.	NULL
3268	If it's hardware  26  . If it's new, we have a 21s, 28s, and 23  .	NULL
3269	It's all hardwire.	NULL
3270	Yeah, because RC five U and RC five  are both  ? I don't have my little cheat sheet, here. RC five S. What are the other ones? S and T?	NULL
3271	I was looking at the RC  but if it's a mix of  hardwire. I don't remember. Was it 20? 20 RC five B. RC five B. That's new. RC five U.	NULL
3272	It's used, I don't remember.	NULL
3273	Yeah, reuse because she says that up here. New RC five U.  Not confusing at all, because that's the whole deal, right? This equipment comes in, it's inventory held for use, they never use it, and they retire it. She says, "Yeah, that's what we actually do on these rare occasions." Today we have to go through these various steps down here in order to do that.	NULL
3274	retired, wherever it is.	NULL
3275	Yes, because we did have that discuss about, "Do you want to retire this stuff at the  Garage where it was never installed?" They were like, "Yeah." So, we're going to retire it wherever it is.	NULL
3276	? Never get rid of it. Sitting there, "Why's that still in the corner?" "I don't know. They retired it   ."	NULL
3277	We got a day to do that, right?	NULL
3278	More than that.	NULL
3279	Do some stuff?  Is that what you want your task to say? Do this. Do this.	NULL
3280	Stuff.	NULL
3281	Just give me that Dopak. Yeah.	NULL
3282	That's going to be...	NULL
3283	12?	NULL
3284	want another one. You're going to have to change the UI to at least allow that to be an option. What do you want now?	NULL
3285	Two?	NULL
3286	OK, anything else?	NULL
3287	.	NULL
3288	The good thing about yours is I can look at them and I can go, "OK, now I know what you did." I can do my test cases, because he's really good about putting notes. You're good about putting notes, too.	NULL
3289	I try to be.	NULL
3290	Other people put diddly. I'm like, "That doesn't tell me anything. I still don't know what you did." We have a lot in here now. The next thing that we need to do quickly is we don't have iterations for this. 161 was supposed to start on the 14th and it didn't. Do we want to do...?	NULL
3291	Can we change the date of the iterations since we're clear on that. Nobody  .	NULL
3292	We can't change the end date. The start date doesn't really matter.	NULL
3293	I saw the start date at 3/14  .	NULL
3294	Technically it is, because I started on it. These stories don't write themselves.  I spent hours with  going through it. They don't. I was thinking for this one, maybe we would do three, or maybe four-week iterations? If we really had started the 14th, three-week iteration goes there. If we do a four-week iteration, it goes there.	NULL
3295	I would say four is when we get past Frontier.	NULL
3296	This is May 6th and June 3rd.	NULL
3297	When's he supposed to come through?	NULL
3298	The 17th or the 24th. That actually works out well. The 24th will end our iteration, but we'll actually need to be through on the 17th. We can do four-week iterations. I'll add them in as four week iterations.	NULL
3299	Then I'll need you all to go in and put your stories into the iteration when you think you'll do them. I will try to get test cases in here.  was also going to write the test cases for these, but I really need to sit with him for that.	NULL
3300	I was just saying four because if you said three is going to put us, clash us right with the, when we're dealing with the frontier, we're at the beginning of April.	NULL
3301	The beginning of April is next week.	NULL
3302	I know. I just want to say four weeks is better.	NULL
3303	The iteration is what we get. One iteration  ..	NULL
3304	One iteration  .  another  .	NULL
3305	It's not that we have four weeks total. One iteration is four weeks.	NULL
3306	Right, so you need to do one story before a week from, two weeks from tomorrow, right? I'll add those in. I'll let you know when they're there. You all can put your stuff in there. You just need to decide what your first story needs to be, because it's the one you'll have to have done in a couple of weeks.	NULL
3307	search for market   . I'm more familiar with that, so I can probably...	NULL
3308	Provided those printers work since they've been moved.	NULL
3309	That's something else. I don't know how  that going. Repair service, that's just  .	NULL
3310	That's right, it is.	NULL
3311	Just doesn't have  .	NULL
3312	Thank you everybody.	NULL
3313	That's actually I hope, as in brightest moment as we...really?	NULL
3314	Don't wait for the laundry.	NULL
3315	Door.	NULL
3316	Scene one have to write, and what day of the week it is. Otherwise, I would never know when I talked about the stuff.	NULL
3317	Hello.	NULL
3318	Hello.	NULL
3319	First, we are going to talk about that QUEL that they want for us writing a SQL that will update they're database. I think I sent the email onto you this morning.	NULL
3320	The one on disconnects?	NULL
3321	Yes.	NULL
3322	Yes.	NULL
3323	Smiley recognizes that this will be chargeable work. What they want is they have these 22,000 disconnects. They want to retire all the items that are not related to the central office  code, and not do anything to the ones that are already color coded.	NULL
3324	Here's the spreadsheet that they sent us. Right now, it's filtered by price, but you can take that off. The guy that was working on it was going for the high-dollar items first. What he wants us to do is take all of these assets and write a script that will retire them in LCAM.	NULL
3325	Is  , and so on and so forth?	NULL
3326	Yes. Yeah, they have to be journalized. He did say that.	NULL
3327	What do the color codes mean? They're not related to CO?	NULL
3328	Yes. It's two things. In the first file editor, they have this north, south, east and west location groups. If it's in one of those location groups, then you wouldn't do anything with it. If it's not in one of those location groups, then you would retire it.	NULL
3329	And  on the spreadsheet if they've color coded it then they've already touched it. It's always possible.	NULL
3330	Filtered by color?	NULL
3331	OK, yeah. He's already done something to all of these.	NULL
3332	Don't touch them.	NULL
3333	They don't want us to touch the ones that they've put color on, because they're manually researching on them, figuring out if they want to retire them or not.	NULL
3334	And color code them. Yeah, can you filter it in that?	NULL
3335	Filter by no color?	NULL
3336	Yeah.	NULL
3337	There was a no color option. No fill. So, those...	NULL
3338	Those 22, 247, then you go...	NULL
3339	And if they're not...	NULL
3340	Yeah, if they're not in...	NULL
3341	The realm.	NULL
3342	These profile editor location groups, then you retire them. You give them back the ones that you didn't touch, so that they know they still need to go and manually look at those.	NULL
3343	Don't they know by the ones that are...oh, because they don't know about what's in the north, south, east, west? OK, I got you.	NULL
3344	I would think we would give them back, but for one spreadsheet that says, "Here's all the stuff we've retired, in case you want to double check it. Here's all the stuff we didn't touch, that was in your spreadsheet." Right?	NULL
3345	What do we know about the answers? What do we have on there?	NULL
3346	I don't know nothing, because that's all I want to  .	NULL
3347	I have seen you guys on location.	NULL
3348	And you've got to clone but I don't know if that helps us any.	NULL
3349	We have a price that is the original, the price?	NULL
3350	It's probably not going to equal something that's in...	NULL
3351	I don't either.	NULL
3352	Just first guess.  .	NULL
3353	A silly question.	NULL
3354	There was other calls, or it had...	NULL
3355	So, we had a  .	NULL
3356	Taxes.	NULL
3357	DD column.	NULL
3358	This is related to the other system that he's looking stuff up in, like this bridge here.	NULL
3359	These are network trends equipment. These are more like smart jacks, or like shells that are out on the customer prem. I understand it's because this is what's happening. They only have the people there in the customer prem and they removed the equipment.	NULL
3360	There was always a big debate on the equipment is not worth to roll a truck, to go out and actually get. They're so far behind on it. They don't have the people to do it. They want to clean the records off.	NULL
3361	That's $500 filter that he had on there. Apparently, if it's $500 it's worth rolling a truck for.  If it's under that, it's not. That's very helpful, Caleb.	NULL
3362	I thought he said something about that they don't want you to touch it if it's related to CO, the component.	NULL
3363	Yeah, that's the part of the email where the way that we know that it's related to a CO is because if it's in the north, south, east or west location group on their system then that's the COs that he doesn't want us to touch.	NULL
3364	Oh, I just want to say I could probably go in and get a copy of all the COs that Bill had and by the common language game.	NULL
3365	You all can correct me if I'm wrong but probably what we will do is we'll go in their system. We'll pull this north, south, east and west location groups. We'll filter the spreadsheet about that and then we'll confirm with Smiley that this is what you mean. We are not going to touch these. Then, we'll go forward from there. That's what I would think we would do.	NULL
3366	Yeah, that's the same thing. The north, south, east, west would be...It's just a list of all 50 something COs that they don't have in their common language names.	NULL
3367	OK, you're all trying to think how you would actually do this or you think you'll just talk about location and this equipment. Can we use a vintage or it does it matter?	NULL
3368	The north, south, east, west each have a group of  that's associated with them? Am I understanding that correctly?	NULL
3369	Yeah.	NULL
3370	Yes, and for all the  .	NULL
3371	We can ask Smiley, "OK, for the north, south, east, west, get the list of all the  belonging..."	NULL
3372	We can do it.	NULL
3373	No need, we don't need him. It's in the...	NULL
3374	It's in the database.	NULL
3375	OK.	NULL
3376	We can log into the database. I got it. By the way, I can do that now.	NULL
3377	OK, so we could take those  .	NULL
3378	We can take those  . Get the ones out of here based on those indecipherable 08:50] . Those are the ones we...	NULL
3379	Exclude those.	NULL
3380	Exclude, so what's left over are the ones that we would need to work with.	NULL
3381	That's right. I guess the first question is, is this really chargeable work because they pay for maintenance. Smiley's under the impression that...	NULL
3382	This isn't maintenance stuff.	NULL
3383	OK. They did pay a license fee. I just don't whether it covers. That's how I'm asking is. Would you think that this is something that we would charge them to do or would it be something that he would say...?	NULL
3384	First thought is, "Yeah, we charge for it."	NULL
3385	That's fine because he's under the impression that it is chargeable so just saying it's not chargeable would be like a...It would be better for him but he's expecting to pay for it.	NULL
3386	Who wants to finance maintenance? I guess, is my question.	NULL
3387	The maintenance is doing stuff to the app? I guess so. You ask  about this.	NULL
3388	This one escapes the edge for me. It could go either way. That's why I'm asking.	NULL
3389	When we mention maintenance, it also includes correcting their data?	NULL
3390	Only if we messed it up.	NULL
3391	Yes, that's right.	NULL
3392	Only if we messed it up, which in this case, we didn't mess it up. If we were to estimate it, what's the estimate?	NULL
3393	I wouldn't say we're in two points.	NULL
3394	Oh, yeah.	NULL
3395	Two. That sounds reasonable to me. I was thinking one or two at least, it depends on how much testing you have to do.	NULL
3396	Yeah, we'll take  . Put a lot of queries and we'd make sure it's right.	NULL
3397	Yeah, a lot of verification.	NULL
3398	We'll have to write it on their test system.	NULL
3399	Here's the other thing that's going on. We have a request in now to get their production database. As part of that request, they want us to restore their production to their test again. If they're willing to wait on this until we restore their latest production to their test, then we're a lot closer to their production when we run the script.	NULL
3400	We run it against our test. See what happens. Send him the results say, "Do they look good?" We've run against their test, be absolutely sure. Have them look at it there, and then we can run against production.	NULL
3401	That's reasonable.	NULL
3402	Chris Barry will be back on the 24th. Any  stuff, she will be available again once we ran it on their test, to confirm that looked how she's expecting it to look. Chris Barry is their accountant. She's their main accounting person.	NULL
3403	She's like a contractor. She took seven weeks off. She does this every year though, she takes off big blocks of time. She just doesn't work.	NULL
3404	Eight weeks.	NULL
3405	Do what? It was eight weeks?	NULL
3406	Yeah, every year. She goes to Florida. They have a house down there so she goes down there for two months.	NULL
3407	Nice.	NULL
3408	My question was, on the spreadsheet, all the items status say complete. Is that complete at LCAM?	NULL
3409	No.	NULL
3410	The clause, that are there. The script will have to go in and complete these closeout too, if they're still open in LCAM, correct?	NULL
3411	They didn't ask for that.	NULL
3412	Well I've been telling you, you've got to run it. These clause are associated with this equipment. You're going to have to clean out...	NULL
3413	I would imagine the clause have already been...Are these disconnect clauses or something?	NULL
3414	Yeah. These are all disconnect. Sorry if I didn't make that clear.	NULL
3415	That was one more thing. I would be checking and see in LCAM, log into the system to see if we can find this equipment under these clause to be disconnected. Pending disconnects.	NULL
3416	I realize we didn't do the actual disconnect.	NULL
3417	This isn't an LCAM status. This is the status over in the other system they pull this information from.	NULL
3418	Did the emails say that they're disconnect?	NULL
3419	Yeah.	NULL
3420	Yeah, disconnects.	NULL
3421	It's probably called  . That's the other system probably where they are getting this information from. Where the tech goes in and says, "I did the work." Then nothing ever happens.	NULL
3422	Completed special disconnects isn't even the name of it. Completed is they've done whatever work they're going to do, I guess.	NULL
3423	They did the work, but they didn't do anything in LCAM, is what you're saying.	NULL
3424	He did tell me that the completed column didn't apply to LCAM. I don't know if they're completed or not. I have not looked at the data at all.	NULL
3425	I definitely wouldn't listen to voicemail then. We've got to go find the clause, find the  disconnects. Mark those as complete.	NULL
3426	Only if we did have the clause in here.	NULL
3427	We've been meaning to find this specific equipment associated with that clause.	NULL
3428	OK, so that's more complicated.	NULL
3429	Otherwise we would be social people.	NULL
3430	Hopefully those assets have not been grabbed by something else.	NULL
3431	We'll see. It's not terribly complicated. It's a little more complicated.	NULL
3432	Are we thinking three months to two?	NULL
3433	I think two is...	NULL
3434	You think two will be fine?	NULL
3435	Yes.	NULL
3436	I can ask him. I can say, "We talked about this, would you want us to verify that the clause are closed in LCAM as well, or is that not part of what we're doing?" And say, it's two if we don't have to worry about the clause, it's three if we have to worry about the clause.	NULL
3437	I can't say it's two, and then it's two.	NULL
3438	I think we all agree it wasn't always bigger than a one.	NULL
3439	What did you say  ?	NULL
3440	Does LCAM store the clause?	NULL
3441	Yeah.	NULL
3442	I would think that in order to do an actual retirement, you would have to emulate the retirement screen in LCAM, which I think requires the clause.	NULL
3443	It doesn't require the clause to be retired.	NULL
3444	The retire doesn't need the clause.	NULL
3445	But if you go, the clause just stay in LCAM as open forever, right? Then you've got a dirty  .	NULL
3446	Yeah.	NULL
3447	We still have the list of clause. We can go mark them all as being complete. If that's the only thing that's on the clause.	NULL
3448	You need the clause and the location.	NULL
3449	...has two different locations and two...	NULL
3450	Right.	NULL
3451	All of that has to be...We can't mark the entire clause. We can mark that line as being complete.	NULL
3452	I think Susan has a good point. We just need to ask Kevin if he wants to do a nice clean sweep of it all, or if he wants to leave the clause hanging forever.	NULL
3453	Yeah.	NULL
3454	It could be because he won't slow us back, but they're going to go in and clean them up. I don't know, but I can ask. Is it two no clause, and three if it's clause? If we have to do the clause.	NULL
3455	Is that it?	NULL
3456	No. Sit down.	NULL
3457	Trying to get out of things. I have to write my notes. I will send him an email. It will probably be Monday before I send that email because my hair appointment got changed to 11:30. I will definitely be leaving. So the other one...	NULL
3458	to interview, unless you think he just wants to hear back from you.	NULL
3459	What I was going to do, was write up what we've discussed. That's what I usually do when I send him something back that says, "Here is our understanding of your request." If we do this, then it's two points, if we clean up the clause, then it's three points.	NULL
3460	I basically write what I would put in the story of the email back to him, so that it makes sense to me. Then if he signs off on it, that's what goes in the story. If he comes back and says, "Oh, but what about this?" Then I update and send it back to him.	NULL
3461	You're welcome to try that if you want to.	NULL
3462	I can try.	NULL
3463	Yes, and if you don't mind send that to me, and then if it's OK then I'll forward it on to him, because I can check my emails after I get home today.	NULL
3464	Yes, absolutely. That's what I'll do.	NULL
3465	OK, thank you. That's good.	NULL
3466	I'll draft it up and send it to you.	NULL
3467	OK. That sounds great. The other thing that we were going to talk about, and  you were copied on this from Smiley. It says scanner, but this is where they wanted to talk about the wireless scanners to use with LCAM.	NULL
3468	I'm just going to give the guys an update. I talked to Smiley yesterday about what specifically he means, and in his mind he means is what we mean when we say wireless scanner. It acts just like a tethered scanner, but it's wireless.	NULL
3469	The guy in the field who's wanting this functionality is thinking more of an offline scanner where you sit it into a...	NULL
3470	Docking station.	NULL
3471	A docking station and it uploads a buttload of data at one time. I told him that I have a meeting set up to talk to you guys about this, but that the offline scanners is definitely way more complex than wireless scanners.	NULL
3472	It may not even come to pass, because the whole deal is the people in the field are doing cycle counts. Can you give a brief explanation of cycle counts so we're not the same page of what we're talking about?	NULL
3473	A cycle count is where they go out and look and see what spare equipment they have in these spare cabinets, and LCAM says one thing, and what's actually in the field could be different so it has to be reconciled to what's there and what LCAM has. I don't often Kevin, do you know how often you do cycle counts?	NULL
3474	The field does, and this is who it's for. It's for a Williams, Bill Williams, I believe it is. He's a team leader of the techs in the field. They do it once a month. They go into their maintenance containers, and they reconcile what's in their maintenance against what LCAM says is supposed to be in their maintenance.	NULL
3475	Except that they're behind.	NULL
3476	Well, this I just like...they get time allotted. The techs get time allotted to do this so it's only now in my view they're making these containers. It's not everything, just that. They go in.	NULL
3477	I think right now they're printing off their inventory files and just doing a manual check off of, yes, this is what's in there, no this is...They want an easier, quicker way of doing it, and also using the cycle counts feature to do it.	NULL
3478	So in LCAM they're...yes, OK, so that's why I wanted to talk to you guys, because this sounds like we could possibly let them use DC3 to do this functionality.	NULL
3479	That's what I was wondering.	NULL
3480	But it won't be the CinBell DC3 that they have currently because that's warehouse, and it expects you to do the whole  . It's not at the container level. So maybe do we need...?	NULL
3481	You probably need Patrick for that.	NULL
3482	Let me see if I can get Patrick. I'll be right back.	NULL
3483	Patrick's our DC3 expert. It's his baby.	NULL
3484	Yes. He showed me when I first got here a little bit.	NULL
3485	He's very protective of it. That's my opinion.	NULL
3486	This would mean that DC3 would need to be loaded on those techs' laptops?	NULL
3487	That's what I'm thinking, and maybe is that what you're thinking, too?	NULL
3488	I don't know how they use DC3. It guess so.	NULL
3489	When you all did the warehouse...	NULL
3490	You were there, weren't you?	NULL
3491	And today they're not doing them in LCAM. They just go off and...They print off their inventory and then they checklist it as they're doing their cycle count.	NULL
3492	Patrick's here.	NULL
3493	The thought of having Kevin Smiley's thought with the wireless is that they can take a laptop over to their storage cabinet and scan, and it'll talk to...or if they have a desktop, it can talk wirelessly.	NULL
3494	They've got the scanner. They can have their cycle count up and scan the stuff in. That stuff sounds more like DC3, which I did have that thought when I was talking to him about it. I don't know why I didn't invite you to this meeting. My bad.	NULL
3495	If you wanted to do a cycle count that was entirely on the web side of things it's basically like what you're talking about doing a bay audit where you just take the raw data from somewhere, dump it into LCAM, look at it up there, make your adjustments, and then push it through that way.	NULL
3496	You could also do that entirely on DC3. Right now it only works at the  level so you'd have to adjust it to where it would only narrow down to a particular frame ID. The challenge there is that with the whole recon process that's there it's a little bit overkill in a sense.	NULL
3497	Yes, and this is like techs in the field doing it. The learning curve could be huge.	NULL
3498	They can spell their name and that's about it.	NULL
3499		NULL
3500	What did he say?	NULL
3501	They can spell their name.	NULL
3502	Say how you really feel  .	NULL
3503	I'm saying it, that's how it is.	NULL
3504	He's been there. He's seen it.	NULL
3505	We could modify DC3 to maybe smooth out that process a little bit to where it's not as complicated, or streamline it. You can go either way. You're basically either...you've got to simplify the process in DC3 to only work at the frame ID level and strip out a lot of the...	NULL
3506	The recon process is for the whole location, and it's pretty granular as far as being able to make adjustments as you go along so you get the whole inventory for the whole office just right before you actually push the button to pump it back into LCAM.	NULL
3507	The plus side about that is you use laptops and just simple, inexpensive 2D barcode scanners that you already have to do all that if they wanted to do the bay audit kind of a thing. There was a cycle count function in there at one point in time, right?	NULL
3508	It's still there. How does it work? I'm sorry, I've just forgot?	NULL
3509	How do you put information into it?	NULL
3510	Does it stop it from sourcing when you say you're doing a cycle count?	NULL
3511	No, you're talking warehouse. Warehouse cycle count is different from the field.	NULL
3512	I don't think I ever tested the field cycle count. How does it work in LCAM?	NULL
3513	You just go to that page and say you were doing a cycle count for this  . I don't know if it's  end bay. I think it is,  end frame.  end frame, and then you just say, "OK, I've got eight of these plugs, nine of this one."	NULL
3514	Do you just key it all in, basically?	NULL
3515	Just key it in. You scan the  , and then you put a count, basically.	NULL
3516	Ah, so this. It looks like I've got 12 of these.	NULL
3517	Then it adds it to the list. You keep doing that until you...	NULL
3518	Will this take scanning information?	NULL
3519	Yeah.	NULL
3520	How do you scan it? Do you just have a really long cord to go from your computer, or do you use a laptop?	NULL
3521	You use a laptop and the tethered scanner.	NULL
3522	With WiFi or something?	NULL
3523	Yes.	NULL
3524	Go ahead and finish what you're saying.	NULL
3525	I don't know what I was saying. Once you do that you hit submit, and then it brings up a screen for you to reconcile them.	NULL
3526	If I hit submit here, it's going to give me a bunch of crap.	NULL
3527	You in production?	NULL
3528	Now. Request web post data. Don't do that to me, David.	NULL
3529	You did that on purpose.	NULL
3530	It says test at the bottom.	NULL
3531	It doesn't matter.	NULL
3532	Are you logging is as CinBell?	NULL
3533	No. I'm on  .	NULL
3534	That really doesn't mean anything. It used to put a file on the FTP server, but now if you go back to...	NULL
3535		NULL
3536	You've got to remember what  you use...	NULL
3537	Process?	NULL
3538	Yes.	NULL
3539	What the heck. Can't type.	NULL
3540	I don't think you need that. You maybe do. I don't know. Just hit fine. There you go.	NULL
3541	So you go to...	NULL
3542	Yes.	NULL
3543	And then it tells me, "This is all the stuff you have. I'm going to talk it all away because you didn't give me anything but D4 D4 SB."	NULL
3544	The easier thing to do is have Data Collector. The previous screen do something similar in Data Collector and then do a web service call. I don't know what that XML file is, if that's anything.	NULL
3545	I don't even think it's reading it.	NULL
3546	There's a table count in there so let's add a web service call that allows DC3 to manipulate that one table, and then after they upload their cycle count into LCAM from Data Collector they'd go to this same screen and keep going.	NULL
3547	Do their reconciliation.	NULL
3548	I have a couple of questions. When they're doing this cycle count can the equipment be moving behind the scenes?	NULL
3549	Can it be moving? What do you mean?	NULL
3550	Like are you preventing anything?	NULL
3551	No.	NULL
3552	OK.	NULL
3553	The point is they're dealing with one frame ID. They need to take a Post-it note and stick it on the front of there saying, "Don't touch."	NULL
3554	Here's the other issue that CinBell is dealing with, and the reason that DC3 may actually be a better solution is a lot of these sites they don't have WiFi at, and they don't have LCAM.	NULL
3555	They just started having these meetings so Smiley is offering them, or discussing a couple of proposals. He's like, "You all need to put in WiFi at all these locations so that they can get to somewhere where there's LCAM. That's $500 a pop to put in some kind of WiFi connection at all these sites that don't have them.	NULL
3556	But if they can do DC3 they don't have to have it, right? They can start somewhere where they have WiFi and say, "I'm going to do this when I get there." When they go there they can do it, come back.	NULL
3557	That has been the only reason that we've ever continued to mess with client applications on a laptop so that you can do stuff like that without an Internet connection otherwise I'd be out of a job, probably.	NULL
3558	We need to give a proposal back to them that's a win/win for everybody.  Where's the Kool-Aid? I'm drinking it.	NULL
3559	If we add a web service call so that DC3 can populate this screen from data that has been collected on the laptop throughout the day then, yes, they could manage this process bay by bay using this.	NULL
3560	Now if they're doing the entire  then they would run it as a full-blown inventory.	NULL
3561	Yes, and at this point they're strictly talking about these cycle counts. Their field people are trying to find a way to make it quicker and easier for them to do their cycle counts.	NULL
3562	I need to add a function in DC3 to let them create a new task just locally for a bay and a frame. We'd need to add a web service call in LCAM for DC3 to be able push that data up to this table here.	NULL
3563	I'd say both of those you could do that, and you could do that in five days. That's the happy path. I don't find anything else along the way.	NULL
3564	Five days.	NULL
3565	Total.	NULL
3566	Total, OK.	NULL
3567	Both for DC3 and for LCAM.	NULL
3568	This has got to be cheaper than buying wireless scanners.	NULL
3569	Oh, yeah, because you're going to have to do the exact same thing with the wireless scanners. The thing that people don't realize about wireless scanners is it's basically you have to make a whole new app to run inside of them. It's a Windows mobile device just like that conduit thing unless you...	NULL
3570	Now there are some off the shelf ones where they will gather just dumb barcode scans, and it'll output them, but at that point none of it's validated. What if they scan a manufacturer's serial number instead of the  or something like that?	NULL
3571	That's the other half of why you deal with laptops out in the field, because you can validate against the catalog while you're standing in front of the thing as opposed to I've gathered a pile of barcodes. Now let's try to do something with it, right?	NULL
3572	Caleb, do you know do all the field techs have laptops or not? Do you know?	NULL
3573	They used to not, no. The COs have their dedicated work stations, things like that for LKM and everything. They have tablets of some sort, I believe, the techs do, but central office technicians I don't think, and I may be wrong, but I don't think that they all have their own individual laptops.	NULL
3574	Are there enough floater owner laptops around to where if a tech needs to go out and say, "Hey, I need to spend an afternoon doing these cycle counts," he could get one?	NULL
3575	I'm sure they could find some along the way, but once again there's like a Kevin Smiley question. To me I think they just wanted to have login in to LCAM and click the cycle count function button on there and then a have a cordless, wireless scanner be able to talk to LCAM just let them do the function directly into LCAM.	NULL
3576	Yeah, but part of the problem with that is they don't have WiFi at all of the locations so their wireless scanners would not work to connect to LCAM at those locations. There's a couple of issues that they're trying to solve.	NULL
3577	Right. Kevin, he talked to me about it as well.	NULL
3578	Go back to that first screen. The problem there is at that point you're back to the problem of just a dumb scanner clicking barcodes. If you programmed the scanner just right you could set it up to where they just blindly scanned the  . They wouldn't be able to adjust any quantities so if they had 50 of something on the same shelf they'd have to scan the barcode 50 times.	NULL
3579	What does that do?	NULL
3580	It just...	NULL
3581	It should combine them when you...	NULL
3582	Do you tab or enter key?	NULL
3583	It's a tab.	NULL
3584	It's a push tab.	NULL
3585	Yes.	NULL
3586	Now do the same one again and then tab.	NULL
3587	I think when you...	NULL
3588	So here now what happens?	NULL
3589	That was what Smiley was trying to bring up to them even with wireless scanners someone's got to be wherever to handle this.	NULL
3590	And that's the problem. OK, so now you're back to you need validation, which means you need a smart scanner, which means you need an app that is specifically coded for that smart scanner, and at that point you're talking about something that costs more than a laptop and tethered 1D USB barcode scanner.	NULL
3591	You're talking back porch now.	NULL
3592	What do you mean?	NULL
3593	Barcode from porch...	NULL
3594	Exactly.	NULL
3595	Then we'll have side shift.	NULL
3596	If you want validation then, OK, you need a smart scanner which is expensive and cumbersome programming-wise or you need a laptop.	NULL
3597	Yes, and if they do it with offline scanners then that's a huge change for LCAM. It's way more than five days' work if they go with offline scanners.	NULL
3598	You're building an entirely new app. That's what it amounts to, which back in the day that's how you used to do inventories, and it eventually got to the point where a laptop and a tethered scanner is cheaper and easier.	NULL
3599	OK.	NULL
3600	OK, so that's the validation problem, and then the other problem is connectivity. That's, again, why a laptop deals with that one.	NULL
3601	I think that we should just, Susan and us should just go back to Kevin and tell him that DC3 can...modify DC3 with a tethered scanner would be the most feasible and cheapest way to go to be able to do what they wanted to do.	NULL
3602	Yes, that's what it sounded like to me, too. That's why we're having this meeting is to decide what's...because what they actually want to accomplish is to be able to do their cycle counts quickly and efficiently and cheaply, because nobody wants to spend money they don't have to spend.	NULL
3603	If we can modify DC3 and LCAM so that they can do that, as long as they can provide the laptops and it doesn't have to be a dedicated laptop. They can have a pool of laptops that have DC3 loaded on them that the techs go pick up when they're going to go do their cycle count, and then turn them back in when they're done or whatever.	NULL
3604	One of the other things to maybe put on there is you could probably put another five days on there. One thing I want to do is change the database that it runs in. Right now it runs off of SQL Express, which is basically installing a small version SQL Server on the laptop itself.	NULL
3605	Microsoft, they came up with...what is it called? Local DB. SQL Express is its own Window service that runs as an entirely separate Windows service. They have a version called Local DB which is a process. When your program connects to a local DB database it's not a Window service that's already running in the background, but it kicks off an even more stripped down version of SQL Server that runs as just a plain old process.	NULL
3606	The installation for that is a lot easier. If you've ever done a SQL Express install it's this big old long thing. It still is a separate Microsoft install, but it's more like you're installing a PDF viewer or just some old plain utility app.	NULL
3607	It's a lot easier install. It's a lot smaller footprint on the computer, and it's not a Windows server that's constantly running. It only spools up after you start Data Collector and start using it that way. That's one of the things that's on the list.	NULL
3608	We could make it work, but it would force them to do a full-blown SQL Express install if they wanted to use it this way. That's just something else that I wanted to do especially for this case. If they say, "Hey, we need a laptop to do this thing," well, they would need this local DB set up and DC3 setup, and it would be maybe 10 minutes' worth of installing as opposed to...	NULL
3609	Like the half a day it took to get one of those...	NULL
3610	Yeah, so that's the thing, too, is you could have an end user do a SQL Express install, but it's pretty...it's scary-looking for them, right?	NULL
3611	Yeah.	NULL
3612	That's one of the old technical thing to throw in there.	NULL
3613	That's good to have. That would be like another five days.	NULL
3614	I call it five days, yeah. Around five days to implement that.	NULL
3615	So those are valid estimates I can give them?	NULL
3616	Sure. They're ballpark. If we're just...	NULL
3617	If we were going with a not too exceed estimate would you make it even bigger?	NULL
3618	My numbers tie then.	NULL
3619	Of what I know before actually diving into it that's what it feels like.	NULL
3620	OK. It's only because I'm going to give it to them so I don't want it to come back.	NULL
3621	If you want not to exceed estimates, double it. If you want not to exceed estimates double it, but that's just random padding at that point.	NULL
3622	I prefer to come in under.  Either way, if we wind up going over they're still not going to pay over five if I tell them five so that's where my question is coming from.	NULL
3623	Unless they want to count this as their maintenance stuff. They get maintenance points, right?	NULL
3624	We were having this discussion about what's covered in maintenance.	NULL
3625	They get maintenance but I don't know what...	NULL
3626	How much?	NULL
3627	I don't know how much or...what's considered maintenance to you?	NULL
3628	I can take all of this stuff to Darrell and to Brett and discuss what's considered maintenance, what could be...	NULL
3629	I thought the license included X number of days of just development work, not a lot, but...	NULL
3630	And I honestly don't remember.	NULL
3631	Can they do the buy of DC3?	NULL
3632	Do what?	NULL
3633	Did they buy DC3?	NULL
3634	Yeah.	NULL
3635	They did.	NULL
3636	They bought it.	NULL
3637	For the warehouse.	NULL
3638	They bought it. It's theirs, so if they want to spend some maintenance points or some money to enhance it to do this other thing it's theirs to use. You can tell Kevin, too, look, that extra five days is to give you the autonomy to be able to do this on your own otherwise you're going to have to get IT involved.	NULL
3639	I guess the other thing you can mention to Kevin Smiley is one of the things we ran into while we were up there is there's a difference between laptops that lived inside of their corporate network that were really tightly controlled, and had a bunch of security stuff that gets preloaded on it and everything.	NULL
3640	You could run on a laptop that's outside of the corporate network but you'd need the VPN client. To be able to talk to LCAM you'd have to run a VPN client to make that connection, and if you have...	NULL
3641	For example, our Alden laptops are an example of that. I could bring it in there. I had access to the public Internet from their network in the warehouse. It would get me to the public Internet, but I couldn't get to LCAM itself until I ran the VPN client, like we do here.	NULL
3642	If they're outside the corporate network then they need the VPN client to run LCAM on the laptops.	NULL
3643	To talk to LCAM on the laptop.	NULL
3644	OK.	NULL
3645	If they wanted the most autonomy running something like that give us the five days so we could use this local DB thing. It'd be a lot easier for an end user to install. Run a laptop that's outside the corporate network so they have admin and access to it to do the installs, and then you could talk to LCAM with VPN. They should be able to do it that way.	NULL
3646	OK. I think that gives us enough to go back with a proposal to Kevin, which actually that proposal will probably wind up coming from Brett because when money's involved it's supposed to go through Brett unless it's part of a release, and what we're proposing would not be part of a...I mean we would have a release for it, but the DC3 part of it...	NULL
3647	Ask Darrell if there's an option for him to spend maintenance points on it.	NULL
3648	Yeah, that's what I need to do is get with Darrell and Brett and go, "What are they paying us this license fee for? What does it cover?" Because I don't know, and I need to know. All right. I think that's it.	NULL
3649	Thanks everybody. Talk you later, Caleb. Bye.	NULL
3650	Are we making changes, get the new view, new view model, and even if you want to start making the changes to taking out the reference to the old user control...	NULL
3651	That will temporarily break it, right?	NULL
3652	Yeah.	NULL
3653	Until we get the new look.	NULL
3654	If you get familiar with XAML, you could split the screen, and put two controls side-by-side. It's going to reduce our real estate on the screen and stuff, but you could split it, split the two columns and put each control in there, and see if we can get them side-by-side might actually be useful for testing, and comparison, and such.	NULL
3655	That's a good idea, maybe that.	NULL
3656	Then you can slowly move one function over at a time.	NULL
3657	That's a good idea. Easy peasy.	NULL
3658	I'm going to have to check these changes in though, too, so you will have them.	NULL
3659	I'll just get recent...	NULL
3660	Yeah, give me the latest version.	NULL
3661	OK.	NULL
3662	I'll do that. Let me get back to my desk, compile a few times, make sure I haven't broken anything, and then I'll check that in and make sure there's no...I'll make sure the application... make sure it still runs. OK, I'll go and check it in. I don't have any TFS, I have to check it in again so I'll see if we have anything to check it in. Have you done any of that yet?	NULL
3663	Done what?	NULL
3664	Have you checked any code in whatsoever?	NULL
3665	No.	NULL
3666	That's OK, it might be worthwhile. All right, so it's got the two changes, that is. Ouch, the project change. I'm sorry. That's it. How would I do this? Alright I take everything and exclude it first, so that I don't accidentally check any of this other stuff in. It's got stuff all over. All right, here's our current project. I'm just going to include that, include that, include these two items. That's it, and update it.  I don't know why they changed. It's probably part of the stuff I was doing  .	NULL
3667	OK, that's just the change we made today, listed there. Typically, I would add, if I work at them ID, so whatever task I might working on, I would add it here. I don't have a task yet, I don't think.	NULL
3668	I know what project this is.	NULL
3669	I think I might have one that sounds really good.  .	NULL
3670	OK, I don't know if it's the... I have one of the collectings.  , and then we'll start with a generic button. OK, here we go,  3.0replacing that point,  collect integration, that's what we're working on. OK, I can add a task.	NULL
3671	We create teller control  model. It shouldn't take us too long but I'll put one hour to half an hour on it, probably another half hour of waiting on it to clean it up and make sure we didn't overlook anything. Two hours estimate, half hour spent on it. We'll put an hour on it just in case. Have you done any of these? Have you created any...?	NULL
3672	Task or anything?	NULL
3673	Task or anything like that?	NULL
3674	I have not, so this is a good walk through.	NULL
3675	Anything you're working on we're going to mark it as development. I'm going to assign this to you. That's basically it. Make sure it's got your name on it. Make sure you got activity and development. You've got an estimate, any time that you've actually put on it, and a remaining. It should add up. You would normally put some description in here, what you're actually doing. This is pretty self explanatory.	NULL
3676	If we were both working on this kind of task, we might put some notes, too, that we might share between each other. You can add task notes, emails, and things like that. Now we have a task.  . We always assign any task as new. It comes in as new. I'm going to go ahead and move it to active because we worked on it. Now it's active. Work has started. That's all we need to check in code against it. That's 18591. I'm coming in here and check code against it.	NULL
3677	It's going to want to send it to resolved. I'm going to associate it. Unless you're totally done with that task, I would always associate it. Associate this code set, or whatever it is, change set. I don't know... Check in this change set against that ticket. It's going to associate with it. You can go in and see all the change sets associated with that item however many times we check it in.	NULL
3678	If we mess up at some point, it will help us track back to what happened, where did it go wrong, and things like that. Make a quick note on here about why I'm checking this in.	NULL
3679	I think that's it. Everything you check in should be associated with a task, if at all possible. In fact, I haven't run across too many situations where we don't have a task to associate it with. That's it. We check that in and  . Change set, it's got that listed so I can go in.  change sets. Anyway, we do have a task. That's your name associated with it. We checked in code against it. Any more time that you spend on this particular task, you can do that and also add another task for updating the... .	NULL
3680	That shouldn't take too terribly long. Put an hour on it. The product managers, before every planning meeting, before every stand-up, they want you to have your task out there. Every story should have your task associated with it, and every task should have some hours on it.	NULL
3681	That's what they're expecting, every time you go to a stand-up meeting. That helps them. You just have some of the managed projects. It should be a lot shorter, because all you're going to say, do you have any obstacles in your way from getting this work done, or anything like that, and have you updated your time.	NULL
3682	You can adjust this. Our estimate may be way off, but you can leave that the same. That helps us gauge  spread this to many. Then just keep track of how much time you actually spend on it. Each  . We're going to have several other tasks as we come across...tomorrow we'll come up with several other tasks.	NULL
3683	This will be the basics. Have the basic view of  created. We're going to unhook the current control. Put the new control in. Then we'll start actually replacing some of the implementation of whatever's happening on the map itself. If we need boundaries, or anything else.	NULL
3684	If everybody else had a task in here, you would have a burn-down chart here. It will start showing you... OK. Here's all the tasks that you have. It adds up the hours and what's left, and she'll start burning down.  It doesn't always look like that. Any questions?	NULL
3685	No, I don't think. This is good.	NULL
3686	Was this productive?	NULL
3687	It was very productive. I haven't worked on anything to actually use this yet, so it's good to know.	NULL
3688	OK. Because I just wing it. I haven't looked at the code, and now I just went with it.	NULL
3689	I'm pretty comfortable with the code at this point. I have no idea of the TFS stuff, so it's good to see.	NULL
3690	Well, that part I do know. The code I don't. TFS I know.	NULL
3691	Cool. Then we both kind of make it.	NULL
3692	We'll work it. Just make sure, if you get the latest, if it shows up, if it doesn't, let me know. Then we'll schedule...Before we finish, we do need to look at the calendar to see when some time...larger block in.	NULL
3693	DuChock. What part of town did you grow up in?	NULL
3694	I actually grew up in Texas.	NULL
3695	Texas, OK.	NULL
3696	My family is from Ireland.  .	NULL
3697	I grew up in... DuChock.	NULL
3698	Who?	NULL
3699	I just remember the family's last name. St Mary that I grew up in.	NULL
3700	Where did you grow up at?	NULL
3701	Just this area Birmingham.	NULL
3702	We were scattered all over. One of my little cousins went to high school here when I was living in Texas.	NULL
3703	All right. Tuesday is not great. Wednesday is better. I can do Tuesday, and split it. I can do...well. Why don't we do 1:30? I've got to run, so that's the most important thing. Just kidding. That's why he thinks, schedule a 12 o'clock meeting ruins our whole day. We can do this, 1:30...we're going to an hour and a half tomorrow,or do we need to do it in the morning?	NULL
3704	That's fine with me.	NULL
3705	Let's just do it here. Let's do an hour and a half in the morning. Some of these meetings may run a little over. Let's do 10:00 to 11:30. Let's stick with that, and get back together that afternoon if we need more time.	NULL
3706	Yeah. That's good.	NULL
3707	Do you want to meet back in here? Does this work, or do we need to meet in the...?	NULL
3708	Yeah. This is fine.	NULL
3709	It seems to be available. All right, 10:00 to 11:30. Does that work? What time you normally do lunch?	NULL
3710	12:00. I might go in, and just...	NULL
3711	All right. Well, that works out.	NULL
3712	accept.	NULL
3713	Oh, did she?	NULL
3714	She was talking about being here.	NULL
3715	She should be here, especially based on the conversation Brian and I just had.	NULL
3716	You missed a good lunch, I'm going to tell you.	NULL
3717	You missed a good lunch, I'll tell you.	NULL
3718	Well, I wasn't invited to yours.	NULL
3719	You guys went to Mugshots?	NULL
3720	Yeah.	NULL
3721	I went to Logan's.	NULL
3722	.	NULL
3723	Mine was free.	NULL
3724	Oh, no. I'm fine.	NULL
3725	You sure  ?	NULL
3726	Oh, yeah. I'm so full. It's horrible. It was delicious but  .	NULL
3727	I ate half my burger, so...	NULL
3728	Mugshots burgers are...	NULL
3729	It was so good. I was trying to force it down, and it was too much.	NULL
3730	You've got a deposit?	NULL
3731	Not yet. We're still waiting on the check, but that's the last thing before we sign everything.	NULL
3732	.	NULL
3733	That and the inspection.	NULL
3734	Oh, yeah, it's tough.	NULL
3735	It's an FHA loan so they have to do an appraisal too. When the appraisal comes back  .	NULL
3736	You what?	NULL
3737	They gave me a hard time for being late.	NULL
3738	You can  .	NULL
3739	Congratulations. You're earlier than  late.	NULL
3740	While Jasmine's bringing up the stories for the HTML5 stuff, I talked with Brian a few minutes ago about how to handle the TFS and the areas for iterations, so we'll just leave it all in the Notify path. We'll figure out what we're going to do in a quarter for Notify, but then we'll have to just be cognizant.	NULL
3741	Technically, when you're working an Agile process, you're supposed to be able to release, if you want to, after every iteration, to production. We'll run it that way. We'll have this release of the Notify, whatever we want to call it, we need to decide that.	NULL
3742	Like, your release that's going out in a month can have an iteration of coding and an iteration of test and release it, because there's still iterations within this, so that Mahesh and Baski might be working on stuff and so that's what we have to manage is how you can work on stuff that doesn't go...	NULL
3743	You're just saying, put them somewhere, and then pull them into the actual iterations? Is that what you're talking about?	NULL
3744	Yeah, but then some stuff won't probably be usable.	NULL
3745	.	NULL
3746	Because you have confirmed releases going on at the same time. We've got this HTML5 release.	NULL
3747	I know.  .	NULL
3748	Well, you can talk to Brian. Brian had a team that worked like that at the beginning, and he said it was just a nightmare to figure it out.	NULL
3749	Was it different code bases or it was the same code base?	NULL
3750	It didn't matter.	NULL
3751	Are you talking about for this?	NULL
3752	For HTML5.	NULL
3753	Baski can...What's the situation?	NULL
3754	We decided that...	NULL
3755	I withdraw the question.	NULL
3756	I don't mind providing an answer based on experience. You guys don't have to accept it at all, really. You can look at it either way. All I can do is just bring past experience to the table. You guys can make the decision if it's  . Do I need to go where I told you?	NULL
3757	You can, but...	NULL
3758	Or we can do it at a different time.	NULL
3759	We've got two hours, so...	NULL
3760	I guess my first thought is, if you're going to have a bunch of Notify stories, like Karen's doing them, some of them relate to the  .	NULL
3761	What? You could have two different teams working on the same code base, and they'd still have the same release, is what Brian said. You could have people on the HTML5 team that are getting those stories, and other people...	NULL
3762	At the end of the day, it is the same, unless we were going to branch the code base, they're all working on the same code base, and they all need to be checked in and ready to go.	NULL
3763	working on the same thing.	NULL
3764	Do you know? I thought we were.	NULL
3765	Because HTML5's website  . I guess .	NULL
3766	I know it's going to get sticky when we start talking about  and functionality too.	NULL
3767	You're saying it's a tradeoff, I guess. If we have to deal with the stories  , that's a lot easier issue than if we have .	NULL
3768	You really have two pieces of the puzzle. Number one is resource allocation. I have a set of resources, and they need to be working on something  . How much they do, I wouldn't be able to predict what functionalities .	NULL
3769	Then the second side of the coin is we have code, it's spread out across a lot of different modules, or locations for the location in TFS and  what they're working on.	NULL
3770	they're separated TFS, judging by the same, what your asset is.	NULL
3771	There is TFS. My point is that, from my experience, allocating somebody 60 percent to one thing and 40 percent to another thing doesn't allow you to develop a true velocity for your team, so you'll never know what your team is capable of.	NULL
3772	We tried that a while ago, and it didn't go well. It was very difficult to say... Because some people on the teams were split like 60-40. Others were split 30-30-30-10. A majority of it was based on what the project managers felt at the time.	NULL
3773	Our production went down because of all the context switches everybody had to do. We found it better to say, "This team of six people is going to do one thing this iteration. You're going to do these stories this iteration. This team, you're going to do those stories."	NULL
3774	Usually those stories stay within the same context, so this one might be Conversations, this one might be Reports, this one might be  . That's just my experience.	NULL
3775	It was my understanding that it would be the same code base so that we could do things intermittently. Is that not true anymore? That's what we had talked about.	NULL
3776	When we're talking about HTML that's not the solution.	NULL
3777	There are going to be two websites.	NULL
3778	Is it?	NULL
3779	I think so.	NULL
3780	Why?	NULL
3781	I thought it wasn't. I thought we were doing it as one, so if we had this contract management stuff that was using the HTML5, it could sit on top of whatever we've got now.	NULL
3782	No, I would be violently opposed to that.	NULL
3783	If you're running it on your phone.	NULL
3784	Like mobile and  . I don't think that's a good idea.	NULL
3785	Mobile  but the HTML version of it, because it's going to be incomplete. I just thought in order to be able to release, the functionality that we want to release without someone thinking that this is a new version  .	NULL
3786	I see. Like,  , for example, was working on the new version of their website  specific version , whereas if you just went to www.  version two website. You're saying throw in a different sub-domain until it's ready for production...	NULL
3787	Unless there's another way to say it's the version that's going to come up if you're running on  or something like that. What I thought was the very first release we put out there you're going to be able to run on your phone and you go to this website. If you go to this website you can access it on your phone or your iPad.	NULL
3788	Do we want our users to do anything differently if they get to this on devices that are currently unsupported?	NULL
3789	Not ultimately. I thought that's a way to, like I said, without saying there's two versions and they decide which one you want, I thought it was the best way to present it to our user base, to say, "We have this mobile version of our website that you can access." Ultimately it replaces them. If there's a way to do that seamlessly without them knowing any difference...	NULL
3790	We can determine at will whether or not the users are in  versus  .	NULL
3791	The thing I don't want to happen is I don't want them to say, "Why is this? I lost my functionality." I have to have a way for them to get to it. I want them to know consciously that they're getting a subset of functionality, and that's what you get on your iPad or on your phone.	NULL
3792	Another thing that you can do, and I've seen this pattern used on  as well, is that when I was in the newer version, functionality wasn't complete, but there was a bar across the top that said, "You're using a new version. If you'd like to go back to the older version that has all of these features, click on this link up there."	NULL
3793	I'm thinking, at least early on, in the first couple of releases, it would be more like if I'm on a phone or an iPad, and I go and it says, "Function is not fully supported on this browser," so you're getting this subset domain.	NULL
3794	Or, like I said, if they know ahead of time, we can just tell them, "You can use it on your iPad which is limited  ." I guess that's the way I envision it. We automatically detect...	NULL
3795	But they wouldn't be able to go back to an older version on the Mac.	NULL
3796	Yeah. Then the other thing we talked about a little bit and this is along the lines of what Darryl was thinking...	NULL
3797	is as we add features, you basically launch it from the current website. If it's a new thing that we've done, you can go and it opens up a new HTML5 page on our current one, but you couldn't do that as a mobile thing.	NULL
3798	Realistically, though, architecturally speaking, whether or not you wanted it on the website or the  ...	NULL
3799	It's the same project.	NULL
3800	All that, I'm going to figure out how, or that's just kind of the problem. I want to be able to release something without releasing it all.	NULL
3801	Right.	NULL
3802	For TFS, we can keep the Notify team, and then I can create...I've done this before, I have something called  , and then as those things are pushed into real iterations, I just move it over to that iteration, so we can keep all these stories in an HTML5 iteration.	NULL
3803	However, that's not an iteration that's actually ever delivered. It gets put into the actual Notify iterations. Is that what you're saying?	NULL
3804	If it's the same website, then obviously it's going to be the same release, and they're going to have to be able to get to them. If it's two different websites, then you could release one  . I think what you just said, we could work all those things out.	NULL
3805	It should be easy enough to keep them separate. If there's a story that goes in that says, "You may be able to login," obviously, someone's not going to...Something a little more is needed on the side conversations which is,  .	NULL
3806	What are we looking at here? What is Trello?	NULL
3807	Trello is a project manager app. It's on the Web. It really makes it easy to add stuff in a way that people can see your project, the whole thing. What we did is we made different columns for each of the epic stories. You've got a login page, home page, navigation, maps, conversations, reports, training, all those are epic stories.	NULL
3808	Under each epic story, we have a sub-story and then some of those sub-stories might have sub-stories under them, and those are check boxes right now.	NULL
3809	Where are you going to use  ?	NULL
3810	This is like a temporary thing to  .	NULL
3811	It's a lot easier to view everything, than TFS is. What we want to do is get the stories right on this, and then move them over to TFS so that there's less work in the long run.	NULL
3812	I guess for this exercise today, these are the epics and we can start trying to put some high-level estimates on them. At the end of the day, we really want to know how long this whole project, to get this whole thing turned over is going to take, the high levels and then we can work out which ones we want to try and do first and scope out that work.	NULL
3813	We know we've got two quarters to work with. We've got Mahesh here for at least two quarters. That's the expectation we've given them.	NULL
3814	Starting in April?	NULL
3815	It started today, really. That's what we said. Now that could be tomorrow, or the next day, but...The iteration, first iteration starts today.	NULL
3816	OK. This 1.20, Release 1.20 that I have in there right now, has got to go out at the end of the month, so that's two weeks. I'm assuming, because that has all the stuff from  , the changes, and anything else, I have that being set up, for us to figure out how that goes out within those two weeks. I'm assuming none of this will be in that first two weeks.	NULL
3817	Well, there might be some stuff coded that right now that's not checked into the database, it's all...I don't know where Mahesh...	NULL
3818	If there's something simple enough that it's a testable thing, it's just not used in production as long as it's testable...	NULL
3819	Yes.	NULL
3820	at some level, that's fine, we can stick it in there.	NULL
3821	Come April, we need everything checked into that code base, in the Notify code base now, here and more so, an emergency release going on in a couple of weeks. None of this stuff...	NULL
3822	OK, so I don't have to worry about that right now.	NULL
3823	Right. What we want to do is on a big level, make sure that we captured everything here, and then see if we can figure out a general full-scope, figure out what we want to do first. Then that will end up being the first iteration, and at the end of this iteration we'll see what Mahesh has  . We have our Agile classes to know what's good.	NULL
3824	Right now, Karen and I have had a class, Brian's done it, so as far as that process is concerned that's where we stand on that.	NULL
3825	Have we decided for searching or asset arrangement under something?	NULL
3826	I think it's under Home page.	NULL
3827	?	NULL
3828	.	NULL
3829	Search assets is under Navigation.	NULL
3830	Navigation is the bar on the top, so the thing that was already in there and then in the report we added  Navigation.	NULL
3831	OK.	NULL
3832	Then on the home page this basically  .	NULL
3833	Joel, what approach do you want to take for this, or Joel, Baski, or both of you all, as far as do we want to just make sure first that we've got all the functionality that old Notify can do?	NULL
3834	I want to do that. That's ultimately, you have to have that but I don't want it to actually be  . I want to go see a pole on a map. I don't want to say, "Search, poles, ." I want the map to be part of the application.	NULL
3835	You go to the map, on that map, you show whatever you want and from there, you can do what you want. There still has to be a way to filter down to something. I'm not real sure how to group that together in the sense of, say if I have something like a list of contracts.	NULL
3836	They don't really have anything to do with the map. I still want to be able to have an intuitive way to get to my list of contracts. I don't know what's the best approach to that from a user perspective.	NULL
3837	What I do want, if something is mappable I want to go to that page that has a map on it and it'd be like  . I could sit there and filter, which becomes my search criteria. Searching for conversations, poles, conduit and these are the criteria I want to find and it just displays that stuff.	NULL
3838	If I want to, say, use a list, it shows the grid. That all makes sense. Maybe that becomes just the list and the map is just insignificant in that. But all that stuff is similar to the way they have it but not like where you have to go tab, tab, tab, where you can see all that at one time and place. That's the difference. I don't know where is goes under the...	NULL
3839	Can you add notes to these parts?	NULL
3840	Yeah.	NULL
3841	Yeah.	NULL
3842	Stories.	NULL
3843	You can add all that as notes, so maybe that user can search for assets on that individual location, and then you can work off of that, build your Balsamiq step flow out of that. Then we can create real usable stories on that. Because I don't know what the user stories are for that because you haven't designed it yet.	NULL
3844	That's why we did an epic for Navigation, as opposed to just for Search.	NULL
3845	Because there's two things there. There's searching mappable assets and there's searching just assets that have absolutely nothing ever to do with the map. That Search Asset needs to be broken out into two different things.	NULL
3846	That's why I'm saying like the contracts or whatever it is. It's almost like I don't want it to be a different approach. We're still filtering it down to, if you just want a map or not, the map is there. A lot of the times, I guess when it is...	NULL
3847	You have it broken down a little bit more inside there.	NULL
3848	You could use the technique like a bounding technique to kill off the things that are going to take three years to do and say, "I don't want to spend more than 50 points on this," or, "I don't want to spend more than 20 points on that." Whatever design you come up with, ultimately has to fall within those constraints.	NULL
3849	I guess that's my big question on my mind. Do we go to this map page and see all these different components or do you go to an invoice page and you launch from there?	NULL
3850	I think Darryl, your question, though, really is, "Do you want all of the stories or epics defined today?" We're not necessarily going to implement them all. We don't have to design them all right now but do we need to make sure all the functions are up here?	NULL
3851	I just want to see if that's the best approach, to go through, make sure we've got all the functions covered and we know we want to also do this  functionality, so make sure that's covered. Brian, let me ask you this. Is it a standard practice that we would try to estimate all of these epics or is that even possible?	NULL
3852	Or would it be better to just have something in mind and then break it down to prioritize it and start working it at according to level? At some point, I at least need to know, is this going to take six months or two years? But I don't want to spend forever on pie in the sky, how long is this going to take?	NULL
3853	We're at a little bit of a disadvantage and at the same time, at a little bit of an advantage here because usually, when you have a project, somebody's throwing money at it and they want a particular piece of functionality.	NULL
3854	That money's worth some amount of points. At that point, we say, "I'm going to give you X number of points because you've given me X number of dollars." We don't have that same philosophy here but we still know, you still intrinsically know, "I don't want to spend any more than this amount of time on this particular functionality."	NULL
3855	At the high-level epic, I would still think that you can say, "You've got 50 points this iteration to do whatever you think can be done." If you need to break it out into epic one-stage one, epic two-stage two, that's still fine.	NULL
3856	You still prioritize the highest priority ones up to epic one and say, "You've got 50 points on this and whatever you've got has got to fit into that block. Otherwise it falls down and you've got to do it somewhere else." That's what I recommend. We don't know exactly what this looks like but you've still got to rack and stack it.	NULL
3857	Say, "I'm going to give you 50 points on this epic. I'm going to give you 20 on this one. I'm going to give you 70 on that one." That would at least let you progress through the first part of this and move on to more of the detailed design. You may end up with a detailed design and go, "Yeah, I could probably do a little bit more," or, a little bit less, it could go either way.	NULL
3858	I want to make sure that we've got things covered and then I would say, maybe, start trying to prioritize a bit, the things that we want to be able to accomplish. Talk about the approach as far as checking in, maybe trying to get Jasmine up to speed a little bit on what Mahesh can do, cross-training and...The hardest part right now is resources on the back-end with Baski and Brian.	NULL
3859	Jasmine and...	NULL
3860	Mahesh.	NULL
3861	Mahesh, are going to do the UI stuff?	NULL
3862	Yeah.	NULL
3863	UX stuff.	NULL
3864	One thing that I think that home page probably needs to be either split up or...I guess what we need is a conversations home page. What we have today, the home page, is basically your conversations where you launch new conversations and open existing conversations. That's got things like, Reports that go on their own home page.	NULL
3865	Has what?	NULL
3866	It's based on Corey's design.  all these tiles and then it also says,  to customize your tiles, edit your tiles on that system but editing on a home page is basically just this and then I think it says something like, "Save these conversations in a grid."	NULL
3867	The tile changes within the display window, so if you click on, "My Conversations," it would be all the conversations that you're a part of, kind of like running a SafeSearch.	NULL
3868	That's what Notify does today but then you also have the ability to open search. I found that to be  . I guess that's where I'm struggling with what the design's going to look like.	NULL
3869	You can start at Search. You can have that be the first tile that's selected every time you login.	NULL
3870	We don't have to get the detailed design for this right now.	NULL
3871	I'm just trying to find a way that would be an epic  home page.	NULL
3872	Yeah, that's not really an epic because it has a bunch of other stuff in it.	NULL
3873	Like I said, I want all that to be integrated, on one page per se. I'd love for it to be like a map here and this is what you're seeing. Like, "This is where I'm doing my work now." If I want to do some adjustment to what's my data set, I want it to be  . Maybe it's like  and the search and it's just advanced, "This is what I want to see."	NULL
3874	How's that different from the map? I don't want to now go to the map.	NULL
3875	You don't want just the Notify replacement. You want to enhance...?	NULL
3876	Right, I want it to...What you want that user experience to be...They just have to be able to do what they can do, ultimately.	NULL
3877	It doesn't have to  , they just have to do what they can do.	NULL
3878	I'm not 100 percent  with what we've got.	NULL
3879	This is based on a meeting that we had with you last week. These were the epics that we came up with in that meeting and we ran with that from there.	NULL
3880	I know we said, "Home page, basically that's where you're going to  ." I think when we talked about that, how will that tie this together?	NULL
3881	You want the home page to just be  ?	NULL
3882	I guess it's like Zhivago, that website we were looking at. You go and you zoom, your home page, it's got a map in the background, it's got a place so you can say, turn on what you want to see.	NULL
3883	.	NULL
3884	To me that's like what...	NULL
3885	Or like Zillow, you start by putting in an address. You come here and pick the context of, "Buy," "Rent," "Sell," or, their estimating thing. Then you put in your address and click Search and it takes you to that area.	NULL
3886	.	NULL
3887	Either way, you can still have an epic of home page, or whatever. There's going to be a page when you logon that you go to. What's in that particular page might be different.	NULL
3888	Zillow is probably the best example.	NULL
3889	Is the name going to be that conversation  ? When someone logs on, here's my work and I can go from there and do my thing, I guess.	NULL
3890	That's what we were doing with the tiles was that picks the context of what shows up in the main view area. Like you have here on the right, you've got things that you might be looking for. Instead of that we've got tiles of how you can change what's being searched for. If you only want to see the conversations that you're assigned to you click that tile. Then that's all that it displays.	NULL
3891	That all lends itself to this Notify being conversation-centric. Is that your question? To continue it that way?	NULL
3892	Right. But what I'm saying is that if when you login you're on the Search screen, instead of My Conversations you're on the Search screen, there's just a map there. Then you can add your search criteria from there. That's where you go to every time you login.	NULL
3893	If you wanted to see My Conversations instead of that map all you have to do, instead of running your own search and doing that every time you're going to search...	NULL
3894	Right. Then you just click the tile and that's what shows up in that viewing area.	NULL
3895	Where does the epic for the map come in? Is that a subset of...?	NULL
3896	Maybe it would just be under the Search. Although you're saying you want the Search to also just show the map side-by-side, like have a list view and then a map view?	NULL
3897	The reason that we made the map that's on the epic is because there was a lot of pieces involved in just the map. There was drawing bounding area. There was adding search criteria. There was searching for different types of assets.	NULL
3898	That can be fine. It may be under the area of the implications, just another area of the functionality.	NULL
3899	Right. It's a part.	NULL
3900	Here's an example of what I hope we can avoid. Today when you logon you've got your list of conversations. You can change that to say, "My Conversations," "Conversations assigned to me," use the same search and everything.	NULL
3901	Open the conversation from there, but you can't just go search for conversations that you want and you can't go show those conversations on the map. If you want to do that you have to click Search, select Conversations, do your search, go all the way down and see that on the map, so it's duplicate functionality in two different places, neither of which has got everything you need to do.	NULL
3902	There's a lot of crossover but what I want to avoid is...I'd almost rather have a Conversation page, and you can search and you can show the map, than have it the way it is today.	NULL
3903	Do it all on one page.	NULL
3904	Right. Maybe it's like you have your home page and you're doing it, or maybe you duplicate these for different things like for  and for conversations, and  .	NULL
3905	What I was actually thinking of was home page, maybe Conversation home page. I don't know if that's worth doing or not but, like I said, I don't want to have duplicate areas of that.	NULL
3906	Right. This gets rid of that because it's the same viewing area, so you would be able to see your conversations on the grid, and a map, and a calendar. If you have My Conversations selected, then you can do that with those conversations. Or, if you have Search selected, and you add search criteria, you get the same kind of list, map, and calendar options.	NULL
3907	Basically, you're thinking of it being a way you set your criteria of what you're seeing and then you can save it as a tile. That's what this is.	NULL
3908	Yes, exactly.	NULL
3909	I guess we can shift that to develop things then to me, one of the first things you're going to do in this version is go down, logon and that gets you to the Conversation page, if you're on, let's say a mobile device and say, "What do I want to see on here and..."	NULL
3910	When you login on the mobile device all you see are the tiles. Once you click the tile that's when it brings up whatever you put it in. On a mobile device you can't have it to where you just logon and it  , you have to know what you're searching for.	NULL
3911	When we have all that real estate then we can show the search area on a big map, and all that stuff, but we're dealing with such a small space we have to give them the choice when they logon of what they want to see next.	NULL
3912	I just want to make sure, however we're set up for release, we have the ability to do it that way  .	NULL
3913	You don't really have to have home page to think of it, "This is the way we're going to organize the tiles and these things." You're going to have Reporting, so that's an epic and whatever's involved in that. You have your Conversations and then whatever's involved in that. Maybe that's the way you should organize it. Like, "Manage conversation," is your epic and however that's designed.	NULL
3914	.	NULL
3915	OK, well then maybe some of these things need to be moved over to the Conversations.	NULL
3916	Yeah, I think so. I like...	NULL
3917	You can get rid of this concept of this home page.	NULL
3918	This whole concept needs to be managing joint use now. We need to start thinking of Notify as managing joint use and joint use relationships because that's what we want it to be. We need the personas...	NULL
3919	It's managing assets and then actions. I think there's still going to be two.	NULL
3920	Yeah, but you're still...	NULL
3921	Then the asset  .	NULL
3922	If you think about it from a mirror image perspective, it's like, "Now I want to go and deal with my contracts." Is that all? Then you've got to bring in some kind of navigation because you have to have the flow of how you get back to  and you'd put that under Navigation.	NULL
3923	But you might have...	NULL
3924	But Reports is in both.	NULL
3925	Yeah.	NULL
3926	Ideally, when we get mature in this whole process we're going to know our personas for everybody that's a user of this system and start from there. Right now, we've taken this Notify thing and we're going to try to redesign it and move some of the functionality in.	NULL
3927	But when we start thinking of, "80 percent of my users are attachers doing this. 70 of them are, or 10 percent of them are managers of joint use departments and pole owners and this is what they're going to want to do." That's going to drive what...	NULL
3928	Zillow you've got the buy, sell, rent, zestimate. You could literally almost come in and say, "I'm an attacher."	NULL
3929	Or just know by...	NULL
3930	The user tag what type of user you are.	NULL
3931	We already have that knowledge. We have Notify for the most part for, what, seven, eight years? We have that knowledge. Why isn't that name they go by the same? We know Notify for a long time. We know all the software of Notify  .	NULL
3932	I think we have to. I think his design does  , but I'm just not sure, like if I'm sitting here saying, "We're going to work on this epic..."	NULL
3933	He's just trying to organize the users' stories, not...	NULL
3934	Is this going to allow us to come up with iterations that...?	NULL
3935	The different swath of epics would be  . Not all of them would be by role. Not only would you have epics on both the slides but then you might have, underneath that, another swath of epics for that particular epic that you're breaking down by a particular role.	NULL
3936	You might have a home page for the attacher versus a home page for the, give me some roles, asset manager versus contract manager versus...	NULL
3937	If I was going to say, "How are we going to do this, first?" I would be of the mindset to say, "I can do it with My Conversations. Forget the Contracts. List the Conversations, they're there." I can logon. Somehow I can get my list of conversations I care about. I can open one of those conversations. Then I can see what I need to be doing. I can see that information.	NULL
3938	Some of this lays out right here, but I guess maybe the epics might be, and I don't know if home page is the right word but at some point I want to manage my conversations. At some point I want to be able to manage my poles. At some point I want to be able to look at my conduit.	NULL
3939	You want to manage a project, as well, for our internal people. That's completely different.	NULL
3940	That's something that's maybe  not really there. In Notify it's there right now. But to me, managing a project is the combination of those conversations and assets. That's more of a, "How do I take all of these assets I have and these things I have to do and reconcile those together?"	NULL
3941	Maybe, for me, I might feel better if the epic was the conversations for the home page. Maybe just say an assets page.  and when I open the next asset, and the next asset, so I don't have to open up these things...	NULL
3942	Basically, what you've done is you've pulled a list of these things, these conversations that you're managing. I can see where you should be able to search for them using your tools on the map and you should be able to save them using tools like your map, like a calendar and all those things, and dictate what subset of those conversations you want to see.	NULL
3943	That's what you're sort of doing. I don't know that having them somewhere  falls into that same thing.	NULL
3944	What's the Search at the top and the Search as a tile? That's confusing to me. What does that mean?	NULL
3945	I think the navigation bar, that's always up there. On the level lines the tiles are going to move off the screen when you're on another page because they're not roving, so you have the bar up there so you can click it or  so you click it or  and get the tiles.	NULL
3946	Yeah, you're not always going to get them on the home page with the conversations but if you go back to...	NULL
3947	Search.	NULL
3948	I don't think we're accomplishing much right now. I'm not sure where we're going.	NULL
3949	It depends on what we really need to accomplish and what that is. I feel like we talked about, six months ago, "What are the first things to do?"	NULL
3950	That's right.	NULL
3951	Yeah. I think the only thing we need to think about is...We've talked about the most valuable thing, I think, for Notify is going to be getting this JRM functionality in it. We know, if we're going to be selling this JRM, all these JRMs...	NULL
3952	That's where things have somewhat changed a little bit. We know that's going to be very valuable. We also know we want to get this dashboard somehow integrated because that's proved to be very valuable. We just need to make sure that when we're doing this application now as HTML5...	NULL
3953	If we went down the thought process of, "Let's login. Now let me view My Conversations. Now let me add it," like we talked about before, we need to at least make sure that navigationally, when we're bringing in this JRM and dashboard functionality and stuff, we don't make that ancillary to doing a conversation and, "Now we're doing this management," and it's off to the side.	NULL
3954	I think we need to think of it as, "I'm a user. This is what I'm trying to do." I agree with you that that might still be the very first thing we do, we just need to think about, "I'm Maggie and I might be doing this and this. Right now all I can do is open my conversation but in six months I'm going to be managing JRMs, so am I going to completely change home screens, now?" That's all.	NULL
3955	Let me just put this back  . The one thing that's holding me back from going down this one path we're about to go down is the fact that we might want to see two things, right?	NULL
3956	Conduit and  . What do we think about that? We think about what we're going to do is right now you can go in there and say, "You go to the Search screen. That gives you a list of everything you can possibly want to look at." I can go to a checkbox and choose. Basically, this home page, there is a home page for each thing that we want to manage.	NULL
3957	That would be a little bit along the lines of the JRMs. The thing right here is good but let's just say you're saying, "Conversations." If your tiles maybe say, "Searches," and your other thing is, "Create a new one," something like that, then you may go to a similar home page for poles, which has the exact same layout but you're talking about poles instead of conversations.	NULL
3958	I think, at some point, particularly when we get to the map and  the map if it makes sense to let's say it may have additional things that you could view as reference. That can be something that we put on a back burner.	NULL
3959	You can think about that home page epic. There's one of those per each thing. I think we did get into a little bit of trouble because there's a lot of things we can't do on a conversation page that tries to stay open and generic.	NULL
3960	We can't search for a conversation that has an attachment on it that belongs to this company because we're trying to do something generic. It's an easy query but we  do something  .	NULL
3961	We can at least leave ourselves the ability to do some very specific things on that  . That way we could easily start out with Conversations and we could have a parallel path to look at the same thing for contracts because we have  contracts.	NULL
3962	That would lend itself to being more like JRM where, say you're home, you login and you go to a home page that right now it's all linked but you've got a home page that has everything that you can do. You've got assets, billing, reference data...	NULL
3963	People like that.	NULL
3964	workflow, with everything underneath it. You click on Poles and then you've got your links to all the things you can do on the poles.	NULL
3965	If there's a person that only has Notify for joint use, or whatever...	NULL
3966	Then you could just take them there. They go directly to the conversation.	NULL
3967	they go directly to the landing spot or whatever.	NULL
3968	People did say, up in class,  they really like the organization of JRM. It's very easy to know exactly what you're doing and go into it because of the way that home page is done.	NULL
3969	That's fine.	NULL
3970	That makes it a little...	NULL
3971	It's not far off from what we have right here. The thing is the map is going to be integrated into that page, at least when you're on a desktop situation.	NULL
3972	Out of curiosity, where is it that I see the map?	NULL
3973	We don't show it here.	NULL
3974	Where the grid is right now.	NULL
3975	It would be right here.	NULL
3976	It would be where the grid is right now.	NULL
3977	The way I would see some of these things is if you think about a Web page you can move, it can collapse the search criteria, or you can collapse your saved searches. You can bring down the list versus the map.	NULL
3978	Just like the home search sites where you'd start on the map and then you can add criteria to it to narrow your search down. If you only want to see single family homes, or condos, you can filter that out. That would be like poles or...	NULL
3979	Everything that would be searchable in here would be similar to a search-based scenario where if you're doing poles, or you bring up a house or I can filter it down. I can see the list. I can see the map and it's just going to  .	NULL
3980	The big difference to me that would be a little bit more like year-end is if somebody wants to go search for poles, they don't click Search and then, say, "Look for poles." They'd be like, "I'm going to poles."	NULL
3981	I'm going to the poles site.	NULL
3982	Yeah, I like that.	NULL
3983	As opposed to going Search, select that, put it in your criteria, then click the tab, and it shows you the map.	NULL
3984	Sometimes, you don't have to put criteria in. You can just go right to the map. That was confusing in my class in Connecticut to them.	NULL
3985	If there's just something I want, I can click on it.	NULL
3986	The functionality is there.	NULL
3987	If you've got the tab functionality other than the Conversation.	NULL
3988	The functionality is there. The user experience is not the same. For us, it's fine because we know.	NULL
3989	Yeah, we've done it forever.	NULL
3990	But there's still certain things you have to know before I click Search, and go to the map, and then it incorporates that. That's the thing we're trying to solve, so if you want to just change that epic  .	NULL
3991	Conversation  ?	NULL
3992	We'll do it specific conversations  because then it's  . We want it to be really in the next iteration...	NULL
3993	I like that. Now we've got all of this. Is what is in here all the Notify current functionality?	NULL
3994	Yes.	NULL
3995	That's what's here?	NULL
3996	Mm-hmm.	NULL
3997	What we need then, is, we need specific things with dashboard, sharing functionality, and managing projects.	NULL
3998	Is the dashboard Baski's dashboard integrating that into Notify? Is that what that is?	NULL
3999	I think so. Baski, you can speak up if that's...	NULL
4000	I would say we should be able to do a conversation dashboard, and then maybe a project dashboard.	NULL
4001	.	NULL
4002	Like what you've been doing is project dashboards, because they're very specific too. But a conversation dashboard would be basically using dates and  .	NULL
4003	What we need is a way to have a dashboard that takes certain tools that are on the dashboard, and they are received from a certain way of passing in data, so that it doesn't have to be a new dashboard built every time.  was talking about doing a data source for it.	NULL
4004	If you do it similarly to the way you did the map and the grid, you just design, "This is the way I want to see the data," so you could build it in to where it's behind the scenes for the data source. But I think also you can do a non-specific, because we know the Conversation...	NULL
4005	Have the statuses.	NULL
4006	has a create date, it has a timer, it has a status, it has  ...	NULL
4007	You could pie chart and get the statuses based on time.	NULL
4008	It has mappable features. A lot of the things that you do already, whether we come up with that generic thing that speeds up open conversations. That's an epic, probably, as far as...	NULL
4009	That's all.	NULL
4010	Scroll down on your conversation home page, a generic search. What does that mean?	NULL
4011	Generic search for a conversation. It was generic because there were other searches on that list, but...	NULL
4012	I would call that basically, "You can filter your results," because you know you're there, you're there in the conversation.	NULL
4013	Hit, "Filter results," that's probably a good way to do it. Just, "Filter results," you don't need the "search" in there.	NULL
4014	Those things are basically just some kind of saved searches. From a user story...	NULL
4015	When we create the stories, we could put that under, "User can filter the results," and these are some examples inside that Filter Results.	NULL
4016	That's a good example of user story that reminds me again of SafeSearch.	NULL
4017	Yeah, because we can't see the recently changed things, so that's new, which they've asked for a long time.	NULL
4018	I would say, for as far as what we're doing today, I can have Jasmine get with Baski and Joel or something, and get some dashboard stories and make an epic for the dashboard and when you get with me, we'll make some stories on a JRM functionality. Joel's got some ideas on that.	NULL
4019	I think as far as the iteration to start with, if we can get a website up,  .	NULL
4020	By credentials.	NULL
4021	By credentials. There's things we can put in an iteration so that in two weeks when we have our...	NULL
4022	Let's think about, right now, what our resources are. Baski's fairly limited for how long? I know you've been working with Mahesh, but you've got a relatively full plate for...	NULL
4023	We've got Fast Path.	NULL
4024	Fast Path and...We need to make sure we can fit some user storage in there to keep Mahesh going. What's happening right now? You've got your user environment set up in your...? How are these designs that Corey's given being implemented right now?	NULL
4025	We're translating them to  .	NULL
4026	For the user, we're working on an accommodation page.	NULL
4027	As far as the data source for it right now, is it just some mocked up data, or nothing at all, or...?	NULL
4028	.	NULL
4029	It needs to be done concurrently, because what we're talking about here is something that is  . I can't do my conversation page without there being a data source that provides me conversations.	NULL
4030	Going back to the previous experience again, having two different swaths of stories, one for  and one for  , is just a really bad idea, because you can't test all of that until the very end when  is done, and when UI is done. When you hook it up, 90 percent of the time, it breaks, profusely.	NULL
4031	But what we can do, given this current situation, we could have a pre-iteration type thing. Where this is a design iteration, or a design two iterations, but it's relatively usable, I mean it's usable stuff that they're doing, in lieu of...	NULL
4032	There's nothing prohibiting us from doing that. A lot of the time it happens that  is too fast and UI's not fast enough. Or UI's too fast and  's not fast enough. It happens.	NULL
4033	Having the ability to mock data like that keeps it moving, and then you can present it at a demo, and say, "Yeah, I know it's not hooked up yet. This is mock data and this is what we've been working on." That's still less expensive than doing a total rewrite at the end when you realize, that "Hey, this is not what I wanted. This is not what I signed up for."	NULL
4034	Yeah.	NULL
4035	Mock data probably is a really good tool.	NULL
4036	Like you said, it allows the users, or the owner to look at it and see, "Is this the right direction?" while we're waiting for you guys to be ready.	NULL
4037	It's all got to integrate together at some point.	NULL
4038	Better sooner rather than later.	NULL
4039	It seems like year-end. I would like to have an iteration. It might not be what I envision in the sense of  page but that I can logon with the same credentials and I can see a list of conversations...	NULL
4040	Yeah, if it can at least do that right now.	NULL
4041	Or if it can pull up what's assigned to me.	NULL
4042	Let's estimate that from both sides, from whatever Baski needs to do, whatever Mahesh is going to...	NULL
4043	Is there anything wrong with that being the user story, "I can login and see a list of My Conversations"?	NULL
4044	I think I can login is one page. I can go to the website, be presented with a login page and then provide my credentials.	NULL
4045	OK, is one story.	NULL
4046	You can very well have an acceptance criteria that says, "When I login I'm redirected to a page that shows me what stuff is assigned to me." That's perfectly valid.	NULL
4047	.	NULL
4048	Yeah, work together, right.	NULL
4049	It could be dummy data until that's done, but that's perfectly legitimate.	NULL
4050	That you're presented with a login screen is valid, too, but then, what happens after you get in...?	NULL
4051	into it. Something with  .	NULL
4052	That way, I can create a test case for it, and give to someone...	NULL
4053	that if you login and it says, "Notify page coming," at least you've logged in.	NULL
4054	There's nothing wrong with that.	NULL
4055	Then, once we have that, then you can start with testing the website, "I want to be able to register," and that's all for a different path and it's so easy to get  .	NULL
4056	I can't do it, but...	NULL
4057	That give us...This is the best way I can think of to...	NULL
4058	Yeah.	NULL
4059	I don't want to end up doing all these great pieces and then  .	NULL
4060	That's why I like epics. I look at all of these bullets that are underneath that and really, the stories that go underneath an epic are the acceptance criteria for the epic.	NULL
4061	There's nothing prohibiting anybody from creating a top-level epic that says, "Release 1.0Then nest all your epics underneath that and maybe have an even higher level epic on the conversation home page where it just says, "Epic home page," which has all the epics for all the different types of home pages that we have, conversation, reporting, whatever you want to say.	NULL
4062	There's nothing prohibiting that. Then, even having the dashboard underneath the epic conversation home page, where there's an epic conversation dashboard, there's nothing prohibiting that. Again, it allows it to roll it up to where the epic has acceptance criteria, because all of these are acceptance criteria on each of the epics.	NULL
4063	It's up to whoever's flushing the story out to determine whether or not they want to create stories for that, because even the stories can become epics if you break those down. Nothing prohibiting that.	NULL
4064	We need to try our best to come up with a list of doable work/stories for this iteration, and then maybe between us meeting together a few times, some of us in the next two weeks while that's being worked, try to start coming up with a good backlog of stuff so that we're not sitting here each time trying to come up with  what we need to do.	NULL
4065	In the Agile classes, we're always taught the user story, "As a something-something user, I can do this," and we'll have a task that needs to be done to accomplish that as far as the development tasks go.	NULL
4066	Correct, but, a project manager or ScrumMaster or a product owner think the whole notion of an epic is a set of related user stories. We haven't gone to users and said, "Hey, what do you want this to do?" If we did, this would be a lot more trivial.	NULL
4067	I know, it's hard.	NULL
4068	What we have now is what we think is the problem with our existing application, and what we think is the right solution for it.	NULL
4069	We're attacking it from the opposite side. We're attacking it from the top down instead of the bottom up. Now I've got a placeholder for blah, and I need it to do blah really, really well, but I don't know what blah looks like yet.	NULL
4070	This is again, going back to release planning. All of that, if we do it the right way, will be laid out ahead of time, so when we come in here, we're not talking about, "What stories are we missing?" We're talking about, "What needs to go into release one? What needs to go in relation to release whatever?" We've got to get to that point.	NULL
4071	Right now, not only does Baski have the Fast Path stuff, but then this Friday we got put on us that we have to do this other being able to logon and  through the Notify. You don't know about any of this, Karen, but the map...	NULL
4072	the MapPoint, get rid of MapPoint...	NULL
4073	Get rid of MapPoint.	NULL
4074	and all of that. Baski said he would need to do that.	NULL
4075	the Notify stuff. At any rate, we have limited...We have deadlines for things, but we have Mahesh here. I really want to know from Baski what direction should we take as far as the next two weeks?	NULL
4076	with the data.  Notify.	NULL
4077	We've got what they've got for mock up.	NULL
4078	I know.  .	NULL
4079	In two weeks we've got a URL, and you logon, and it checks your credentials through the Notify test, whatever, database, and he's got that home page with that data behind it.	NULL
4080	.	NULL
4081	Male Participant? Are we going to say we're going to have the three  ?	NULL
4082	Yeah,  .	NULL
4083	Three what?	NULL
4084	Three devices, phone, tablet...	NULL
4085	OK, got you.	NULL
4086	Phone, tablet, tablet.	NULL
4087	Phone, tablet, tablet, right.	NULL
4088	Mahesh, can you estimate doing that?	NULL
4089	The user story, "You can login with a tablet, you can login with a phone, and you can login with your PC"?	NULL
4090	Yes.	NULL
4091	Those are the acceptance criteria.	NULL
4092	Those are going to be the sort of constants. Because that can be responsibly done and basically says, "That's it."	NULL
4093	I would love to actually really create test cases  supposed to be doing that so that those are in there all the time.	NULL
4094	If we keep it all together, we keep Baski's stories that we're working on, the other five stories that we're working on in this iteration...	NULL
4095	Yeah, if that could be done in the two weeks, then they could all be in 1.20.	NULL
4096	2.0Female Participant:  Oh, you want to change the release?	NULL
4097	I think if the release is...	NULL
4098	She's saying you can include it in 1.20 without...We're not releasing any of this to the public in 2.0Female Participant:  Right.	NULL
4099	No. No, we're not.	NULL
4100	But they'll be in there.	NULL
4101	It can be released without anybody knowing it's there.	NULL
4102	As 1.20, because I have bug fixes in there.	NULL
4103	Yeah. That's fine. I was just saying, as we start this thing...	NULL
4104	What's being worked on then right now?	NULL
4105	we should change it to 2.0Male Participant:  What's being worked on then?	NULL
4106	The two stories you did before I left, that weren't released for production yet.	NULL
4107	All that's been built.	NULL
4108	That's been built and is ready to go, it just hasn't been released to production yet. I've got to look at the permitting thing on the conduit.	NULL
4109	The question is, "Is it going to be rebuilt?"	NULL
4110	Yes, we'll need a rebuild.	NULL
4111	What's being changed?	NULL
4112	What's in there right now, what's going to be changed?	NULL
4113	What you used in training, everything, as far as I know, works that's there already. I just have to put it in production.	NULL
4114	Right. But there are some other things that came up that I need to talk to you all about, which is in...Did I schedule that meeting yet? I don't know that I did yet. There are some other things that might need to be changed in the next two weeks. I don't know.	NULL
4115	If we do this, what we're talking about, it shouldn't impact anything that's in existing production. If it's a different URL, then we know  URL.	NULL
4116	Will there be something that I can test under that bit, whatever is going to be developed?	NULL
4117	Test what?	NULL
4118	The login.	NULL
4119	She doesn't want something checked in, we deploy the current Notify, and we've screwed something up. That's all she's worried about.	NULL
4120	I already told her this. We are not touching anything code wise, without  needs to be doing.	NULL
4121	It's not going to be the same URL for this.	NULL
4122	It's a different URL. After the case is opened up, that's it. There's nothing going to change the current Notify functionality. Nothing. You just login, often because we have to check into Notify, that's it. Other than that, it's not going to be anything more on Notify. You're not going to affect any process and applications.	NULL
4123	But if I'm still putting it under that TFS case is it something I'm going to be able to test within the next two weeks?	NULL
4124	Yeah. That's what we said. We're going to do it and within two weeks. Of course, we haven't let him answer the question yet of his estimate price. We're assuming that we will be able to.	NULL
4125	I'll make sure that you know exactly what to do. How about that? That way when you guys want, you can test this new functionality. No confusion.	NULL
4126	Can you do that?	NULL
4127	Yes.	NULL
4128	Mahesh?	NULL
4129	I don't have  .	NULL
4130	Which page?	NULL
4131	We don't have any login mock ups at all. He's just doing a page.	NULL
4132	We need it.	NULL
4133	You have the app for mobile.	NULL
4134	and then he can mock up something.	NULL
4135	Big happy face if they login. Big sad face if they can't do it.	NULL
4136	Give them two fingers if it's successful, and one finger if it's not.	NULL
4137	Make sure it's the middle finger.	NULL
4138	That's a user experience, isn't it?	NULL
4139	Can we make it like a blue screen of death?	NULL
4140	OK, so Corey's got to mock that up. What about that conversation on the page that you've been working on?	NULL
4141	release.	NULL
4142	But you've been working on it.	NULL
4143	We started this one.	NULL
4144	Is that an open conversation, or is that a list of conversations, is it one single?	NULL
4145	We will provide the front page with conversations.	NULL
4146	The front page with a list?	NULL
4147	Yes.	NULL
4148	That's what we'll do. We login. We land on some page that shows a list of conversations.	NULL
4149	That still bothers me, having to do  .	NULL
4150	.	NULL
4151	Is that responsive design right now where it's...?	NULL
4152	Yeah, it's responsive.	NULL
4153	. I'm going to use the same thing we had on the other page. I need to remove .	NULL
4154	Within two weeks...? Do you have an estimate for doing that without having any data hooked up behind it?	NULL
4155	Yeah, we don't need to do that again. Basically change.	NULL
4156	Then, once Corey gets that login mocked up, we'll see if we can get all that.	NULL
4157	Two weeks is the 25th, are we saying? We're counting today, or not counting today?	NULL
4158	Stating today.	NULL
4159	I'd say two weeks again, a full two weeks.	NULL
4160	I might be off one week. I didn't decide which week.	NULL
4161	In this two weeks? OK.	NULL
4162	Your login was not successful.	NULL
4163	You have two remaining attempts.	NULL
4164	Be careful. We're recording now.	NULL
4165	What was that Jim Carey thing where he plays the  ?	NULL
4166	.	NULL
4167	Do we want to put any other stories in there?	NULL
4168	Let's branch off. I would say, maybe we can...	NULL
4169	Open a given single conversation?	NULL
4170	Yeah, we'll get that story and Karen can create a story. I'm sure Jasmine can help create stories.	NULL
4171	After that, then you can do that under that epic conversation story. We've got a pretty decent list of things that will just be  .	NULL
4172	Yeah. We'll do that. I will try to come up with...	NULL
4173	action. I can see the entities, I can see the contacts. I can sign in. Although there should be stories listed under there.	NULL
4174	I'm going to try to come up with JRM stories.	NULL
4175	The epics costs.	NULL
4176	The problem is, TFS...	NULL
4177	I've got much better ideas after this conversation.	NULL
4178	support for epics sucks. Because we can't do this with TFS 2012. We can do this a little bit better with 2013, but we have multi-level epics and we can't do it with TFS.	NULL
4179	Should I have her not even create the epic in TFS, just do the user story?	NULL
4180	Probably just user stories.	NULL
4181	We could use this and it's free, so we could use this for having epics stuff.	NULL
4182	As long as we stick with one. I don't want some person creating on Google Docs, somebody's creating on this, somebody's creating on that.	NULL
4183	We'll use TFS as the actual user stories, just for organizing it's fine.	NULL
4184	Yeah, as long as everybody uses this, maybe not different ways  .	NULL
4185	This is more, if you want to go and look at all of the epics.	NULL
4186	Well, the 2013 has got an epic work board that looks exactly like this.	NULL
4187	All right. I'm going to try to come up with JRM stories. Joel, I think, maybe the assignment stories. Managing project, I'll send those to Jasmine. Corey's going to create the mock up for the logon page.	NULL
4188	Desktop, tablet, and mobile.	NULL
4189	The hash key's working on that? Baski's going to...Baski or Brian, or both.	NULL
4190	Those things for assignments  .	NULL
4191	Either way we'll need user stories for the single file version. Even if it's just like this. Then, I guess, we will meet tomorrow to go over the Fast Path stuff.	NULL
4192	When you set up a date  report for Fast Path.	NULL
4193	What are you saying, "Fast pass," or...?	NULL
4194	Fast Path.	NULL
4195	Fast Path.	NULL
4196	Fast Path.	NULL
4197	Fast Path. Bold. Bold.	NULL
4198	F-A-S-T, space, P-A-T-H. That's just a name that Eversource uses for some reason.	NULL
4199	I keep hearing Disney. I don't know why. Disney Fast Pass.	NULL
4200	Fast Path. Path. Like a walkway, pathway.	NULL
4201	That's just what they called it. They wanted a fast path to...	NULL
4202	It's a bulk edit.	NULL
4203	It's a, "Don't make me click here, here, here, here and here to enter the thing I do all the time."	NULL
4204	Enter Corey.	NULL
4205	When I do it 500 times. That's what it is.	NULL
4206	Only me and you, and Des and Anne are in that. I don't have anybody else here in on that meeting.	NULL
4207	Does it have any non-budget  ?	NULL
4208	Have you decided  ?	NULL
4209	I don't have a good answer from them.	NULL
4210	Des was sick on Friday, so Karen never got to ask her.	NULL
4211	Des still  .	NULL
4212	They were good.	NULL
4213	I want them to understand what the options are...	NULL
4214	and for us to come up with...It shouldn't be a real long meeting, but just come up with the direction is what the purpose of it is.	NULL
4215	Just to say, "This is what we're doing," and then build from there, unless you...	NULL
4216	His preference is another app. That's not my preference.	NULL
4217	His preference is what?	NULL
4218	His preference is a Web app.	NULL
4219	Windows app.	NULL
4220	Windows app. My preference is an import-export inside Notify thing.	NULL
4221	I mean, Baski's right. If it needs to be, if we need to provide dropdowns and things, that's very helpful.	NULL
4222	That may make it much, much better for them.	NULL
4223	I'm perfectly fine with that. I just don't want to force someone to go get another tool now. If that's where their direction is, then that's perfectly fine with me. If it makes the most sense for us.	NULL
4224	Best of both worlds is, Baski can do that within Notify, not a Windows app. Did you ever look at that, Baski?	NULL
4225	I looked at the  , I didn't get a chance to explore.	NULL
4226	That's the best of both worlds.	NULL
4227	Yeah. That would be the best of both worlds in there.	NULL
4228	We decided Baski was going to see if that was possible  .	NULL
4229	The first implementation of this would be the print people entering the survey stuff, because that's where  came up with. Those are their engineers. Eversource engineers and Frontier engineers. Frontier is the ones that were complaining, like, "No, heck, I'm not using Notify, because it sucks."	NULL
4230	All they do this complain and complain. It's like, "Stop."	NULL
4231	But the problem was Frontier's not going to do it for whatever reason. Eversource was forced to do it for them. They don't have the capacity to keep doing, click here, click here, click here, click here. Eversource would ideally want Frontier to do their own surveys.	NULL
4232	Both need to be able to do it quickly and efficiently, because they both have surveys to do.	NULL
4233	The engineers take it to the field?	NULL
4234	Ideally that would be great. I don't know that that's a necessarily a requirement right now. That's what I'm getting from them.	NULL
4235	Anybody can leave.	NULL
4236	Anything we could take to the field to me would be more important. This is the problem, if Frontier refuses to do it still, they're going to have to do it desktop. That would be the most likely...	NULL
4237	so that we can coordinate?	NULL
4238	I think Daryl needs to prioritize it first because it sounds like we already have two projects going on concurrently. We need to focus.	NULL
4239	I know. Let me see if I can conference you, I'm going to put you on hold.	NULL
4240	OK.	NULL
4241	Thanks.	NULL
4242	Hey  . Hello.	NULL
4243	I need to try and conference you in with Brian.	NULL
4244	I just wanted to let you know I've got to...I don't know if I'm going to be able to stay on here because I've got to go up to the warehouse.	NULL
4245	OK.	NULL
4246	away.	NULL
4247	In that case, if you want to just hang out, I'll just tell him that you're not available for the call today.	NULL
4248	OK, that's fine, that would be perfect because I won't be. I'll get back on a little bit later.	NULL
4249	OK, sounds good, thanks.	NULL
4250	Alright, thank you.	NULL
4251	Bye.	NULL
4252	Bye-bye.	NULL
4253	Did I scare him away?	NULL
4254	Hey, Brian.	NULL
4255	I'm here.	NULL
4256	Kaylow, actually, he called to tell me that he needs to not be on the call.  I was like, "Good, I don't need to figure how to conference." You think before I even have a kick-off meeting that I need to get with Daryl to get clarity on what project we're doing?	NULL
4257	Yeah.	NULL
4258	OK. I can do that. I just got a call yesterday from Matt, asking me about the Mobile Collect. I'm like, "I can't tell you anything about it." It's a Frontier, I haven't even had the chance to look at it. I'll try to look at it today.	NULL
4259	All right, I'll do that then, before I try and schedule something. It's 9:21. I'm bringing up what we have. Do we still have testing the CTDI? Did they send something else yesterday?	NULL
4260	Mm-hmm, they sent one before.	NULL
4261	The last thing that they sent, you said, "Yeah, we got them all, and they're all good." We can probably close this, because I don't imagine I'm going to do any more testing today.	NULL
4262	That's your call.	NULL
4263	We're going to be closing up good tonight.	NULL
4264	If they want, send something else. They probably check it, it should be in SELECT statement, but what was sent looked good, and maybe...The work closed, worked.	NULL
4265	OK. Then I will just fail to test-run test this. Brian, do you have anything that we need to talk to them about on the call today?	NULL
4266	Probably, but I don't know yet.	NULL
4267		NULL
4268	Because it probably won't be on this morning's call, but I'm about to start working on the work orders. I don't have blanket project information that I can tell or estimates for this stuff, so I'm sure that's going to get in the way. I'm not quite sure how they're going to want to handle that. I need to dig into this a little more so I can more appropriately formulate a question for them.	NULL
4269	OK, so where are we at with the rest of their fallout in general? Do you know?	NULL
4270	I have about 20, 30 million assets, about 231 are falling out.	NULL
4271	That's not bad.	NULL
4272	No, and that's because there's one particular FRC, never seen before .17 records have that on there and then the rest are bad catalog references. I think we've got all. None of the catalog information is falling out. There's only one location that's falling out and that's because the three character one doesn't have any assets on, so it doesn't affect anything.	NULL
4273	OK, yeah, they said they were going to leave that alone anyway.	NULL
4274	Yeah, and then the other point looks to be that the...crap, I was going somewhere.	NULL
4275		NULL
4276	That tripped me off.	NULL
4277	.	NULL
4278	Yeah, and I don't even touch that partly, so there's still that whole falling out there. I'm trying to get at least to the point where they're functional business wise so I need to get the work orders in there. I think ship orders escaped my...I was looking at the publish package for this version, and I noticed that I was publishing ship orders before and I'm not even importing those now.	NULL
4279	I didn't even consider ship orders, so I'm going to have to see if I can pull that information in at some point either today or early tomorrow too. As far as fallout is concerned, it's looking pretty good this time around and they're actually letting me make generic rules that prevent stuff from falling out.	NULL
4280	OK. That's good. Maybe the next time we do this for somebody, we should give them trial run to show them they're going to get, so that then they understand what we mean by "Fallout."	NULL
4281	I think the next time we do this, I'm not going to do it.	NULL
4282	I know.	NULL
4283	We need to give them the schema to ETR catalog extension after there's commitment, and so they take...you give us your data and you put in this format and then roll.	F
4284		NULL
4285	Kim imported the database to Mary.	NULL
4286	Yeah.	NULL
4287	Do you have any questions on the users? I know you all send some emails back and forth. Think you're good now?	NULL
4288	I think I'm good. I was here until about eight o'clock last night, getting all the date array. I had it parsed through the names to separate the first class and from the initial GET.	NULL
4289	Just basically getting it towards ready to go in the user's tail log. I've got to delete one user from the script though, because he's already in the user's table. Ken Howard, he was already in the user table, but he's also in this spreadsheet.	F
4290	We might want to just ask him about that, because that's weird. If he's a Verizon employee, then he would already be in Frontier's user tables. Do you think it's worth asking him? That's just weird.	NULL
4291	That is weird.	NULL
4292	I'll gather the info and send you all the email and go from there.	NULL
4293	OK. I just want to make sure there's nothing else that we need to be concerned about.	NULL
4294	He's the only user out of the 3,373  that's already in the user's table, and his user roll's already set up, too.	NULL
4295	You're planning on importing that, when?	NULL
4296	I can do it, whenever. I'm ready. I just have to know what to do about to him.	NULL
4297	I would think you would do that tomorrow, right before we back up the database?	NULL
4298	OK.	NULL
4299	Backing up the database, our test or their test, do you remember?	NULL
4300	Ours.	NULL
4301	Of course.	NULL
4302	Yeah, OK. I don't know if that was something...	NULL
4303	I'll get an SQL to him, to put them all in and set their user rolls.	NULL
4304	You can do that maybe when you're doing this. Stop the work, close the interfaces running the scripts for 1.1. Were you going to do the production backup or was Brian? I didn't put names, I just put...	NULL
4305	What was the question? I couldn't hear it.	NULL
4306	Sorry.	NULL
4307	I didn't know if Grady was going to do that, or if you were planning on doing that, Brian.	NULL
4308	It doesn't matter. If you guys are doing it tomorrow, then Grady's probably going to be the better person, because I'm going to be calling it early tomorrow afternoon, I'll be out to  .	NULL
4309	You probably had already danced.	NULL
4310	Yep.	NULL
4311	Oh yeah, I forgot about that. We can't really start it until eight o'clock anyway, based on our stop timeline event, which isn't until seven. Grady, you might want to take half the day off tomorrow, since you're going to be working half the night.	NULL
4312	I'll decide to come in later tomorrow.	NULL
4313	Maybe work from home in the morning and then take the afternoon off and then work for the whole night.  Whatever you want to do. Doesn't matter to me, because you're the one that has to work.	NULL
4314	Anything special we have to do on backing up or just follow my gut with the interface?	NULL
4315	Right-click, back up, and then I'd probably make sure that you don't back up to a backup file that already exists, you probably want to do that. The backup shouldn't take long, but you'll probably want to 7-zip it.	NULL
4316	Like I did last time?	NULL
4317	Yeah. That will take probably half-hour or an hour to do that. Then you'll probably want to open up Internet Explorer and then go to the FTP site. From the Internet Explorer, tell it to open it up in Windows Explorer, and then copy it to the FTP site that way. I've had really good luck of low latency and quick copies doing it...copying file like that.	NULL
4318	We'll get to back it up 7-ZIT, and put it on our FTP site.	NULL
4319	Yeah.	NULL
4320	Will you pull it down from there and restore it when you get ready to start?	NULL
4321	Yes.	NULL
4322	OK, so he goes to step five, and then you'll restore it when you get ready.	NULL
4323	You might want to put names to these, so I can know who's doing what.	NULL
4324	Yeah, I can do that. OK, I got to hang up and call in, it's 9:30.	NULL
4325	OK.	NULL
4326	Nice.	NULL
4327	Call you.	NULL
4328	Bye.	NULL
4329	Bye.	NULL
4330	Hi, who's on the call?	NULL
4331	Violet.	NULL
4332	Good morning, it's Kim.	NULL
4333	Hey Violet, hey Kim.	NULL
4334	Brian's on.	NULL
4335	Hey Brian. Anybody else on the call?	NULL
4336	Might be a quick call this morning. I don't think we have anything for you guys. Do you all have anything we need to talk about?	NULL
4337	Hi, who joined?	NULL
4338	Hi, it's DJ.	NULL
4339	Hey DJ.	NULL
4340	We don't have anything for you guys. Do you all have anything for us?	NULL
4341	Did Jim join?	NULL
4342	He did not.	NULL
4343	OK, he's on a CTDI call which...Apparently, he wanted me to talk to you guys about...it may be a table field model, and then its DISTOCD, it's in regard to warehousing  warehouses. Brian, he's saying that we either need a copy of that data or if there's a place in LCAM to store it. I'll send that to you via email, but apparently, he just wanted me to bring that up.	F
4344	OK, he's on a CTDI call which...Apparently, he wanted me to talk to you guys about...it may be a table field model, and then its DISTOCD, it's in regard to warehousing  warehouses. Brian, he's saying that we either need a copy of that data or if there's a place in LCAM to store it. I'll send that to you via email, but apparently, he just wanted me to bring that up.	A
4345	OK. Oh, this is the COET data, OK. All right, I'll definitely check into that.	NULL
4346	Thank you. That's all I have.	NULL
4347	OK. Anybody else have anything we need to talk about?	NULL
4348	Apparently not.	NULL
4349	Sounds like it. Thanks everybody. We'll talk to you guys later.	NULL
4350	Bye-bye.	NULL
4351	Bye	NULL
4352	Only a dozen of six words. You're going to ask your ,so that port work with the tile service. Michael, is starting today, what he did. If there is a little background, I can compile.	NULL
4353	We'll try tomorrow .	NULL
4354	Sounds good.	NULL
4355	The best if he says he's going to take care of the branch code. I'll do that tomorrow. I have somewhere to work. That's for the historical based.	NULL
4356	I had to ask her . I think so.	NULL
4357	It was their baby . I'll look at the basic. Oh, man but he said that he was smart. I only try to look one of the clients, which was already against it. Then, come up some tasks. We're having a little point to give what comes up. At this point, I want to have this.	NULL
4358	Yeah, actually...	NULL
4359	You got to teach...	NULL
4360	I want to try and load one of the clients. I'll do that on mine, and then come up with some task that we haven't at this point accomplished. At this point you know more than I do, so you have to teach me.	NULL
4361	He showed me where to look in a code, where are the configures to toggle, things like that. What to pull over so... I just did it . We could build on that machine if you want to look at the code.	NULL
4362	Let's look at the program first and then the code. Then it'll make more sense to me. I'll see if I can just...	NULL
4363	Also, we had talked briefly about what kind of functionality it would need. Michael said disregard the boundary thing. We will care about how our company,we will care about anything except placing access on the map , so we're running differently.	NULL
4364	Michael said that?	NULL
4365	Yeah.	NULL
4366	And only Michael said that?	NULL
4367	Only Michael, that's true. Only Michael.  I'll go check with...	NULL
4368	Because Karen would validate that from the user's perspective, as she's going to be testing it. She may have different expectations.	NULL
4369	I'll go through and try to install the Tile service client for J.R.M, see if I can get that done. That will help me.	NULL
4370	Hopefully it worked for you, but we had to go through some crazy hoops with the IIS stuff that Michael couldn't initially. It's kind of crazy.	NULL
4371	I want to see what issues we encounter.	NULL
4372	We'll see what issues we encounter.	NULL
4373	How you feel about it so far? Worried?	NULL
4374	I'm not really worried. I get what we're doing. I get what you do, I just don't know where to start. I'm kind of overwhelmed.	NULL
4375	Al right let's see...	NULL
4376	...if I can read this.	NULL
4377	NYW is dot com? . It says dot com.	NULL
4378	All right,  2-3-0-1-0-6.	NULL
4379	Do you have that port on you?	NULL
4380	Hopefully, this is the...	NULL
4381	I don't know if this is the map point one or the other tile service one. The tile service one would be to publish.	NULL
4382	I'm going to say JR in collect uses both. Configurable or generic uses just that one, so we're going to move that tile service to JR, and collect.	NULL
4383	We're going to move the top service to support this. I don't know which one it is.	NULL
4384	I know how it went.	NULL
4385	Maybe there was not one for this interview.	NULL
4386	This.	NULL
4387	Don't worry, so I think we've	NULL
4388	Yeah, very original. What was the other one? The one that's published out of the ATM. Is that it probably tile service driven, or now that's production. Sorry.	NULL
4389	Why don't you go ahead and jump on my machine for the time being. That way we can at least look at. Even the is not going to work. We can at least look at...	NULL
4390	The client.	NULL
4391	Yeah.	NULL
4392	OK.	NULL
4393	I can take a look at these.	NULL
4394	You're still going to have.	NULL
4395	It's the community, one of the guys. Actually those are my signals test.	NULL
4396	This right here.	NULL
4397	Close. This is my point that if you want to look at this at all.	NULL
4398	Right.	NULL
4399	I'm still very functional now and I know you can't right click it .	NULL
4400	I can use that.	NULL
4401	I put that for about five minutes . Why can't we just copy?	NULL
4402	I don't know. Right. I'll paste for everybody. You can do that and anything interesting, anything good to know? Anything I need to be aware of for the implementation. Right now basically its just map view, zoom in, zoom out, context menu, copy paste and...	NULL
4403	... route.	NULL
4404	All of this is going to be available in the Telerik map control. Nothing special there. The assets. There is already code to bring in the assets. Nancy said, "don't touch that" . That'll work regardless of the back control so that's nothing new maybe.	NULL
4405	We shouldn't run that.	NULL
4406	We can pull up the code, and it'll load. It was loaded by the interface. Then it started to quit. No maps.	NULL
4407	What code has Baski gone through with you?	NULL
4408	We looked at...map control. The demo bug, the map control. CS , CS file. Those two we looked at. That's where he said our focus is going to be. Yet for some reason that graph design scared me death. why we didn't look below it, the demo file. I have no idea. I discovered that five minutes after meeting with John.	NULL
4409	So all we had to do is click.	NULL
4410	Where was that app?	NULL
4411	I can't remember. Under V-model?  Sink? Go down toward the bottom. Once it's main window, the main window video.	NULL
4412	Here is an example for code files, where we're going to be implementing the Telerik control map, I guess.	NULL
4413	Have you been doing some demo tinkering?	NULL
4414	I've been brushing up on it. I'm an office manager like he said. I found some demos on implementing data maps in Telerik. Since I didn't have the branch code, I weren't able to plug it in and see if it worked	NULL
4415	We do have the Mobile Collect project which has lots of demo examples. It's a different platform, but it should be universal. You need more examples than that. That's not really my only experience with demo at this point, is the Mobile Collect.	NULL
4416	In a minute we can put mobile Collect, because really the only piece of that was of interest there to me was the small little convert file that switched it from map service to...	NULL
4417	Can we look at that?	NULL
4418	Yeah. That's what Michael said to focus in on there.	NULL
4419	This is here.	NULL
4420	Keep using it. I'm sorry.	NULL
4421	Where is the when you need it?	NULL
4422	One second I'll tell you. In code control. Yeah great.	NULL
4423	The problem Michael also mentioned was regardless if we flipped all this to say, always use map files, the program still not going to want to implement what is installed. It's not just copy and paste like you originally said, I guess.	NULL
4424	Yeah. So lots of references to remove from that point until they're off-map. I want to bring those in at run time and run it.	NULL
4425	See if I stuff up.	NULL
4426	Is there any good stuff on the Telerik website that you guys have offered?	NULL
4427	Yeah. I'm trying to find what the demo maps.you see what Michael did, since they want the teller all on. I agree, because it's better to have a bunch of good stuff on there.	NULL
4428	OK. You will.	NULL
4429	That was one we just have to play some.	NULL
4430	OK. Well, my initial meaning for that, time on the schedule today, there was no way you can be able to do that. Get Baskio branch for us tomorrow. That's where we'll start playing. We'll have...	NULL
4431	See if you can build this? Since we think it's one of those 10 problems. If we can build it.	NULL
4432	Does JR collect?	NULL
4433	Yes.build some things, but it's going to be a headache anyway.	NULL
4434	I can do that now, because as soon as I step away, I'm going to be unto other things.	NULL
4435	{pause}	NULL
4436	What do you need the map for?	NULL
4437	I don't have that. That'll have to wait. I log into Frontier. I will hold up on that.	NULL
4438	Whenever you get a chance to do that one.	NULL
4439	Yeah. I can do that, going to get things going. You said David installed that, or who installed that for you?	NULL
4440	That is Baski.	NULL
4441	Baski.	NULL
4442	I haven't seen it on my desk though.	NULL
4443	Is that what you used?	NULL
4444	I used it the first time, in 2006 but I don't understand. So it is a sort of a problem	NULL
4445	I'll get the media for you, and do my best to attend to it today. See if I can get it to four hours.	NULL
4446	I assume that's going to be the Telerik stuff.	NULL
4447	OK.	NULL
4448	...any issues. Last week we went over the status of everything more in depth. What I thought is, maybe try to switch that up, so one week go more into the status and one week go more into the issues.	NULL
4449	That being said, as far as what we're working on right now, what everybody's working on, is there any issues that you know of that we need to capture? Is everything still on track?	NULL
4450	FastPath. Are you going to have something for them Friday or not?	NULL
4451	I'll have something.	NULL
4452	Did she give you that template data or anything?	NULL
4453	.	NULL
4454	OK, so they haven't done their part yet.	NULL
4455	Yes.	NULL
4456	Anything else? All right.	NULL
4457	For the to-do list, we're going to wait until after your add-ons. Put that on hold. Conduit kick-off meeting, we're still looking for maybe the week after April the first to do that?	NULL
4458	Yeah, probably, because  two weeks ago, but  .	NULL
4459	Did everybody have a chance to look at those dates for the Agile class? I want to make sure everybody's here when we do that.	NULL
4460	17th, 18th, and 19th?	NULL
4461	The 19th is a staff meeting.	NULL
4462	The 19th is a staff meeting, so 17th or 18th.	NULL
4463	Yeah, I looked. It was OK.	NULL
4464	We need to  some of these things. Baski, did you figure out how to give a response on some things?	NULL
4465	Yeah. I'll just tell them, "Hey, I've got it," and get a resolution for you soon, or try to give them an ETA, if possible. Not always possible. But I've started to do that on anything, not just the important things that come in.	NULL
4466	I'm not going to change it to 45 yet, since we're going to try going over status one week and issues the next. We've got to keep it at 30 for right now, I wouldn't change it. Let's just look, I saw that, Baski, I don't know if you've noticed, we've got some ideas for training and classes...	NULL
4467	...in here now. We should just figure out when we want to start implementing that.	NULL
4468	This is internal training?	NULL
4469	Yeah. Right now, Baski asked over the last year or so, back when he was doing Friday classes, for ideas. These don't necessarily have to be done by Baski. If somebody else's got something, an interest that they're willing to, has some expertise in these things and want to give a class on it...	NULL
4470	There can be a class probably back again when they did it, and walk us through the whole scanning program.	NULL
4471	He can walk through the whole thing, so that everybody knows what it does. It doesn't have to be me, anybody can learn something new. I think it's beneficial to everybody. It's just a class.	NULL
4472	I'd just say, maybe over the next week or two, take a look at these. Everybody pick their top one or two and then in the next meeting in a couple of weeks we'll...I'll be here next week, but several people will be out next week it turns out.	NULL
4473	Are you canceling next week's meeting?	NULL
4474	I'm not, if you all can still do it.	NULL
4475	You can cancel it.	NULL
4476	Nobody's here.	NULL
4477	Bad attitude.	NULL
4478	I'll be here.	NULL
4479	I'm pretty sure that was domestic violence.	NULL
4480	You're sitting next to somebody who's marrying a police officer.	NULL
4481	What?	NULL
4482	You're sitting next to somebody who's marrying a police officer who will turn you in.	NULL
4483	officer.	NULL
4484	Jenny's joining the police force?	NULL
4485	Can we have a  for the attitude?	NULL
4486	Yeah, she just lost it.	NULL
4487	I'll have to  , no worries.	NULL
4488	OK, again, so everybody just take a look over these and any more that you want to add and we'll pick which ones we want to tackle first. I noticed somebody put the, "Coding best practices," for both uniformity and between applications.	NULL
4489	Actually, I'm talking with Michael about some books and things that we could use. We can talk about that later, though. There's some ideas around that, especially for the new people. Some of us older people are set in our ways, so the likelihood of us changing...	NULL
4490	Bad attitude.	NULL
4491	Yeah.	NULL
4492	That's the way our mind works. Not yet. This one in particular we're going to definitely be working through. But as far as the other ones that are in class people can pick the ones they'd like to see first. With that, on to issues. Did everybody see these? A couple of seconds. Any new ones anybody wants to add to the list?	NULL
4493	It's not really a new one. It's just a concern. I think we need to have a look at this. They had a meeting about this MapPoint and I didn't know there was a meeting. Three different people came to me, "I spent 20 minutes there asking, 'Where do you use MapPoint? What do you do with it?'" I said, "What?" Three different people are asking me. They had actually they are at the meeting and...	NULL
4494	...from meeting they called me about how it's done. I said, "The meeting was only 20 minutes. I should have been in the meeting." "Why?" "I wasted one hour explaining to three different people, all in the same meeting. I was not in the meeting." This would have saved time, everybody's time. That's number one.	NULL
4495	I can't type anything in here now, so I'm just going to write it down. Somebody's got it locked.	NULL
4496	Context-switching, it's not an easy task. Because I switched context in almost like nine things now, support,  support, technical support, dashboard support, dashboard. Then I'm using FastPath. Then I'm using  Collect. You can think of  .	NULL
4497	That conversion to  .	NULL
4498	What is that?	NULL
4499	That conversion to  .	NULL
4500	sometimes.	NULL
4501	When you bring the new people, I think we need to a process to do all this new stuff. Because we're starting a new project. They need to have, "Oh, my God. I'm learning something new. I'm doing something." We cannot just throw in some new person and say, "Go ahead and make a change." They feel so uncomfortable, because it's not the right way to start. I think we need to take a right path.	NULL
4502	Take time, make sure they all know about it. Also, Adam is  on this, the whole MapPoint controversy. I don't know if it's, he really worked on the project, like take the Conduit Project, he worked on it. The context switch took just two hours, definitely made sense. Because he knows what is the context. He can switch it, I understand what's going on.	NULL
4503	They want to put him on the new project for two hours, the context switch is different completely. By the time you get your head around, the two hours is over. You've got to start all over again every day.	NULL
4504	I think, if we can improve that somehow the context switch, if we are switching it, only a person who worked on it. If they want to learn a new application, or whatever new technology, give it to them specifically for a week. Don't just throw them back in and out. It's not good for anybody.	NULL
4505	Context switching, we will add that to the list.	NULL
4506	It sounds like he was also saying, making sure that you have the subject matter expert when you have a meeting.	NULL
4507	Yeah. I don't recall that meeting. I didn't know there was a meeting either.	NULL
4508	Same thing. I didn't know that there was a meeting. I had three people I talked to. From the meeting they called me and said, "What is it? How it works?" I said...	NULL
4509	I'd say at least, if you're thinking you don't want to bother somebody when you're having a meeting, put them on there as optional. At least then they know that it's going on. If they don't have time, they can know that if they're getting questions from three different people, and those three different people are at the meeting...	NULL
4510	Also it helps estimate, because I cannot expect them, these two hours, Adam to estimate what is the workload, because they're not even told what to do.	NULL
4511	I know.	NULL
4512	That's so unfair to them. Because I cannot expect them to estimate anything until they fully understand the context.	NULL
4513	For that particular project, you guys...	NULL
4514	They asked me from the meeting, "How long is it going to take you to swap the MapPoint for this?" I said, "It's going to take two weeks." That's my understanding, but it's not going to be for everybody, because I worked on application I know where to change it. If somebody is learning a new technology, the time frame is completely different.	NULL
4515	I want them to feel comfortable to estimate, than me estimating for them. That's so wrong.	NULL
4516	Moral of the story...	NULL
4517	...include the person that you're getting help from in the meeting. That one was a special case, but we have them more often than not, it seems like. Going to have some in a month.	NULL
4518	What meetings are you referring to?	NULL
4519	Usually, throughout the day we'll have some meeting with you. Then the next day Brandon and I go over...	NULL
4520	It's not you, you are not involved with the meeting. It is a management level the meeting is taking place where they want to change the mapping cards and map. It's outside development level. It's not...	NULL
4521	We'll, make sure we tell...	NULL
4522	...them, "When you're sending messages to people, don't have meetings about our stuff without having somebody from our team."	NULL
4523	Which is historically a thing...	NULL
4524	...that happens.	NULL
4525	That building example...	NULL
4526	I've got an example, the building example yesterday. Obviously something changed in the Notify. Everybody is talking about it, except the development team  . The reason is, something changed in the Notify.	NULL
4527	We not even know. You're just walking in, and finding out yesterday afternoon. You said, "What's going on?"  , "We need some help from somebody." Get all the people as soon as possible, so we can all work together and then go through like 10 different  , and finally come to you for three minutes work.	NULL
4528	I don't know if that one's as good an example. I think, we had the right people on that.	NULL
4529	But there are several occasions where there are no development people involved in these decisions where dates and stuff come out of. I'm working on that one. Anything else? I've got that captured here. If we don't want to add anything else, then we can pick one of these to discuss. See if we can move along before we get to talk about the projects and what you're doing.	NULL
4530	are level three, right?	NULL
4531	Part of it, yeah.	NULL
4532	It's a part of that process?	NULL
4533	We can talk about that. I will say, I added revenue on here today. That's all the revenue. We're on payroll by payroll right now. We're trying to get revenue, in essence. The reason I put that down for marking is, we need to know it. We need to about that. Any ideas people have for quick revenue.	NULL
4534	Yesterday we talked with  about getting the Conduit load, and starting to charge for that as JRM if that's something he's interested in. I thought maybe we'd get some money for it. But short of it is, don't go planning anything right now. We really do need to try to wrap things up. It's not really the time for the scope creep.	NULL
4535	Do you have a list of some things we can make, we can do to make a difference?	NULL
4536	I don't know. That's why I put it on there for us to discuss. We've got the annual goals and the quarterly goals, but the biggest thing is wrapping up. Wrapping up LCAM, wrapping up the PURA stuff and all of that...	NULL
4537	...I discussed a bunch of ideas. He didn't find the time to do it. I didn't have time. Finally I said, "I'm going to put it in." I tried to open the  , it's like worse than  . I wanted to just put in a simple idea, give it to somebody. I don't want to go through like 20 pages of .	NULL
4538	It's too heavyweight for us.	NULL
4539	It should be simple. I just got finished saying to somebody, "I want it like that." I don't want to go asking so many person. I said, "You know what? Forget it. I'm not going to do it."	NULL
4540	OK. That's really good feedback. I think these are some similar feedback. If Ryan and Baski are saying that it's too complicated then...	NULL
4541	I mean, we don't even know how to answer half of the questions that are on there, because we're not experts in that field. I don't know. I could probably estimate how much it would cost for us to do some of those things. But I have no idea what kind of impact it potentially could have on our revenue screen. I don't care.	NULL
4542	It seems like the template is made up for somebody else, and we're just trying to absorb into our process. I feel like it's already build and I just  .	NULL
4543	When we see our software is spread across 400 products and we say, "We like this piece over here, and we like that piece over here," it makes sense for us to put all those pieces together. Somebody ought to be able to look at that, and say, "Yeah, that sounds like a good idea," or, "No. Shut up, and go do it."	NULL
4544	Yeah. Immediate feedback, that's good.	NULL
4545	Our agenda is just wrap up what we're doing.	NULL
4546	That seems...	NULL
4547	To me, and we talked about this a little bit before. Getting this thing Notify, the HTML5, and getting the JRM functionality in, is imperative. I think we'll be able to sell a lot more and get a lot more recurring revenue if we do that.	NULL
4548	I know we're  with it developing prototypes now, but we just don't have the resources on the backend. That's imperative. Getting all of that wrapped up, the Conduit stuff, doing that as efficiently as possible, so we that can turn our focus on...The next thing in the roadmap is going to be rewriting Collect to be our mobile.	NULL
4549	That will help the company tremendously, because then you don't have to worry about pictures. Pictures is by far the longest thing it takes them to do. If you can take it with the device, and get a good one, you're going to speed up our running rates tremendously.	NULL
4550	That's what's next thing on deck. It's just a matter of trying to wrap things up. Getting better about scope creep, so we can get onto these. Get these things up,  , is the best thing our team can do.	NULL
4551	Another point I want to add is context that I think goes with that. In implementing, I think, we have multiple work simultaneously scheduled, and they're all depending on one person, that one person is going to hold everybody.	NULL
4552	Because Mahesh cannot do anything, if I'm not getting anything. They cannot do anything unless I help them out. They cannot do anything on FastPath. If we can schedule the time overlapping, next to them, then we can dedicate the time instead of one person holding all of it. I think we need it.	NULL
4553	That's for sure. That's exactly what we want to do. We want to have these teams, like we've got laid out, and have them be able to work on things. I think we all know, LCAM really has killed us. It's taken everybody but you, Baski.	NULL
4554	Oh, and me. I'm not doing anything on it.	NULL
4555	Well, I mean, development-wise. Baski has been stuck with the lion's share of everything else. We've been able to not move all these other things forward. That one, we will definitely try to guard against doing something like that. Yeah. We'll add that to the list, context switch. All right. What do you all want to talk about?	NULL
4556	I still think we really need to talk about new hire integration. This is probably a good venue for that, because I know that you're talking...You're doing a lot of work right now with this MapPoint stuff. I wanted to hear what you thought about, given a bunch of stuff on your plate, and how that makes you feel. Do you feel overwhelmed?	NULL
4557	He's great. I love it.	NULL
4558	They said be honest with it. Let's go for the truth.	NULL
4559	Honesty is good. If that's exactly how you feel, then that's a great thing.	NULL
4560	It's cool. The stress of responsibility has never been an issue. I like just jumping in. But without a lot of support and a lot of real clear direction, it has been a little stressful, a little overwhelming.	NULL
4561	I know Adam's got his plate full, Baski's got his plate full, so I feel so bad, "I think I broke it," or I feel like I'm going every which way, if that makes sense, because I work with Michael, too.	NULL
4562	Has anybody sat down and showed you Collect?	NULL
4563	Yeah.	NULL
4564	How it works, at least?	NULL
4565	Yes.	NULL
4566	Someone's done that.	NULL
4567	Yeah.	NULL
4568	My concern is, you're fresh out of college. Not saying that you don't have experience at all, but when you step into a professional position, I can remember doing it and I had a lot of hand-holding involved. I was given responsibility, but they were small chunks.	NULL
4569	Like, "We need you to do this little story right here. It might not be a very complicated function, but get your head wrapped around this, and do this part." It almost seems like you've been given this huge problem with no design, with no direction, with none of that at all and expected to automatically become a developer that's been experienced with that. That's the thing that concerns me.	NULL
4570	It is so important, and it has to be done in whatever days it was given.	NULL
4571	That's what I was going to say. There's a deadline on it.	NULL
4572	Yeah, there's a deadline.	NULL
4573	I know that Jasmine, I think you had a similar experience but in a different light. That's the thing that concerns me, is that we're getting new devs in here, which is a great thing, but we're not building them up. I know with Jasmine, at least she was put on JET, which doesn't do anything for the development team at all, and doesn't do anything for her career, either.	NULL
4574	It's a technology that's useful to John and his team, but it's not useful to us as a development team, because it buys us nothing knowing that, for the things that we have to actually do. That's what I'm concerned about.	NULL
4575	We're pulling devs in, and we're just putting them off on the side, saying, "Hey, we don't really have time for you right now, but we're paying you, so we expect you to do something. Here's a project for you to do. It's due in two weeks. Go get it done."	NULL
4576	Or, "Hey, we're doing a total rewrite of our application. We need you to automatically know HTML5 and JavaScript, and CSS, and all that stuff. Go write that stuff."	NULL
4577	When in actuality, I feel like anyways should be integrated into our process to where, "Yeah, I'm working on the story. You haven't done this type of work before. I really want you to sit down with me and do it with me, and then you can ask me questions while I'm doing it, and maybe tomorrow you can drive.	NULL
4578	"Then, you can try it out, and then I can help you with it, and then maybe next week I'll give you just a small thing that you can do by yourself." Then, so on and so forth. That's a huge concern of mine.	NULL
4579	We've got the concern. Because we haven't really done ideas in here, we want to try to solve the root problem. The first thing we do, the, "Why? Why? Why?" is to get to the root problem. I think we have the root problem on here is that we need a new hire integration process.	NULL
4580	All the concerns we know about. We talked about it. We know about it. There are things going on, probably, that everybody isn't aware of, but yeah, we know the issues. The issue we need to solve is we need a new hire integration process.	NULL
4581	The question is, "What should those steps be?" We can start brainstorming ideas. I think Brian just threw out a few. Let's start thinking of what those steps need to be, capture those, and then get them documented.	NULL
4582	Before we hire them they know what the total context is about. Before their hiring, "This is what we're going to be doing." They are already lined up. I think for a new hire integration process this is perfect. Once you bring them in there  what we can do now.	NULL
4583	That's not really how...It was thought about, how they do it. One thing that we try to do, that I try to do, is give people the opportunity to forge the path that they're on. Some people are more, they want to do UX, or some people want to be full stack. Some people want to be more of the nuts and bolts.	NULL
4584	These guys, when they come out, they don't necessarily know. They might have ideas, so to try to expose them a little bit to multiple things to see where they're going to be best suited. I had an idea of where they would be when they came on, but it's not necessarily the correct path until they get started on it.	NULL
4585	You don't want to box anybody in a corner, either. That doesn't do any good for Jasmine, to say, "OK, she's the UX person now." Not that that's a bad thing, but you would probably want to be a little bit more well rounded than that, versus looking at Miranda and going, "You're more data or business logic  .	NULL
4586	That might be OK. That's good but it's not great. Branching out is a good thing, focusing on everything a little bit of everything is ideal.	NULL
4587	You talked about sitting with somebody and then learning. Are we talking about pair programming, in essence. How's everybody feel about that? Honestly. Everybody needs to be completely honest about that.	NULL
4588	That'd be good. I don't know if Miranda feels this way, but I feel like we need to know what the long term goal is for us. There are times where everyone's busy, and we don't want to bother everybody, and we need to know what we can be doing.	NULL
4589	Like, we need to know, what can we be working on besides just scanning through code aimlessly trying to figure out what we can do to help. That's the thing. When I was working on JRM with you, I felt at least useful. It was like every little piece, I felt like, "OK, I did something. That's good."	NULL
4590	Then, it gets to the point where everyone's busy, and we're just researching, not getting to feel like we're helping at all. That's hard. It's important to feel like you're doing something beneficial for the company.	NULL
4591	Long-term goals.	NULL
4592	.	NULL
4593	Pair program, anybody opposed?	NULL
4594	As long as it's not scheduled over the weekend, I don't care.	NULL
4595	Thank you, Baski. I'll pair with Baski.	NULL
4596	It's difficult when you're working on several different things and now you spend an hour actually programming this thing, two hours on troubleshooting issues, and spending an hour on an emergency release that you have to get out. With all of that, there's a lot of context switching going on.	NULL
4597	That's the problem.	NULL
4598	Yeah, that is a problem.	NULL
4599	If we get rid of the context switch, that problem goes away.	NULL
4600	Side bar. Part of this, I'm going to talk with Michael about it. As far as the context switching, maybe we can talk about this in the next meeting, and continue onto this. Let's start thinking about this, but we, as a group, need to start doing a much better job at estimating.	NULL
4601	Whether that's adding factors to our estimates based on what we've historically done or making sure that we have the requirements upfront so we know what's going to be done, and controlling scope creep.	NULL
4602	We as a group have caused a lot of our need to do context switching, because we oftentimes aren't done when we say we're going to be done. For whatever reason that is, and then we end up in a bind because we can't wait until we're done with something before we say we can...We have to keep things in the queue, in the schedule. Maybe next time, be thinking about that.	NULL
4603	I personally think, I'm going to say this until I'm blue in the face.	NULL
4604	But, if our iterations were much more structured, our releases I should say were much more structured, say, "I know exactly. I've got eight iterations in a release. I've got four iterations of testing tacked onto the end of that, and it becomes a repetitive thing that happens exactly the same every single time, the layout becomes a lot easier."	NULL
4605	Because during the last four iterations of testing, now I'm starting to plan out the next release.	NULL
4606	I don't want to derail us from the new hire thing. But be thinking about that for the next meeting. Hopefully we'll be able to control the context switching a little bit. We'll figure out how the pair programming works. I've got it on the list. What else? Long-term goals?	NULL
4607	How long are we going to wait? For example,  we are working on something, and it's supposed to be done  . How long are we going to wait before, "You know what? We're going to put this on the back burner." Who makes that call how long we're going to wait?	NULL
4608	Product owner.	NULL
4609	That's right. Once you have that streamlined, then I give you everything and say, "  , come back in two weeks  ."	NULL
4610	Project managers, they will help with that. We can get a ScrumMaster.	NULL
4611	, right?	NULL
4612	Yeah. I want to wait until after we have our class. Hopefully, we're going to make big strides in all that. What else? New hire process. What else? Long-term goals. Pair programming, giving small chunks of responsibility at first.	NULL
4613	You said earlier, just have an overview of the applications that we're going to have them doing these small chunks in. A training session, on just the application itself. Not necessarily a whole lot of detail, but just an actual demo of it, maybe.	NULL
4614	Where  ?	NULL
4615	Anyway, that can come from me, as in Susan or me, or something like that, to do the demo of it, and then, to have a session with the developer to talk about some of the coding, like how the code is laid out or where is the code, with practice in checking in, checking out, and all that stuff.	NULL
4616	There may be some little nuances to how the code works. Susan and I can do the actual education  .	NULL
4617	We had these quarterly or annual reviews, employee reviews. One of the good things that they have on those reviews is, "The personal goals that you would hope to accomplish for yourself over the next year."	NULL
4618	That would be in line with trying to give direction to new hires about where they need to invest their time, what type of technologies that you should probably be focusing on. That would feed in with our organizational goals as well.	NULL
4619	If you give us the option of focusing from time to time on what we prefer to do, once we have figured that out, can we  ? Because I feel that I know what I like and if it's an option for me to do that, that's when I have a passion to learn. That's what I want to do is just sit with somebody and learn everything about how to do it.	NULL
4620	That is the plan. That was  the plan for...I know you guys came in and we just can't get out from under LCAM, so, I don't have anybody to sit with you.	NULL
4621	That's what we want to try to do.	NULL
4622	I think that it is that you never bother me, always  . If you have a question, come back. Don't ask, don't even email me. Just walk in. I would love to help you, but you've got to make a step. Don't assume and sit there, just come. It's OK.	NULL
4623	That's what I do.	NULL
4624	It's hard to do that when you're new. You always feel like you're bothering them.	NULL
4625	...you can't feel that way.	NULL
4626	Open invitation, there.	NULL
4627	Everybody has to be willing to help when they're needed. I ask for a lot of help, so if someone comes to me I feel obligated and I want to help that person back.	NULL
4628	I'd say that what we need to do is get organized about it, too. Going back to the context switching, and all of that, which is one of the first things that was, requested, was how to manage those things. Baski's talked to us a little bit about that. Maybe we'll delve more into that. He'll organize about how we group up questions, and things like, and organize sessions of learning, and things like that.	NULL
4629	What else? I know we're a few minutes over. Anybody have anything else they want to put in? We can start with this or we can pick it back up next time and try to add to this list.	NULL
4630	I think if the teams are structured the right way and the iterations are structured the right way, then the mix will be good on each team to where the new hire can pair program with the thing that they're interested in accomplishing.	NULL
4631	I would really, really try to steer clear of wearing one hat, because you'll get painted as the UI guy, or the business layer guy, where in the Agile world we need to strive to be multipurpose. We're better tools that way in the toolbox.	NULL
4632	When Drake is out, and somebody can step in and be Drake, or Baski's out, and somebody can step in and be Baski, or when Corey's out, then somebody can step in and be a Corey. We're sharper that way.	NULL
4633	.	NULL
4634	I said it before, I'm not a data guy, but I play one on TV. I did stay at Holiday Inn Express last night.	NULL
4635	That's part of the idea about putting the new people on the Sustainment Team so that they can get exposed to all of the different apps and cross-train at the same time. I'll add to the list.	NULL
4636	I heard what Jasmine said when I got here. I thought that I had to call people to ask for help, because I kept hearing people call other people, so I wasn't sure if I should go to someone's desk, or call them. Then I was like, "I don't like phones," so I started going and bothering Brian all the time, which he probably hates.	NULL
4637	You bothered me like three times? Bothered me?	NULL
4638	Knowing that you can get up and go somewhere is good to be told to a new hire. Not you guys, because you guys know that. Your first day walking in, I didn't know what to do.	NULL
4639	It's good we are a small outfit and not part of a big enterprise, because you cannot find people in a big enterprise. You cannot go talk to the database guy if I work for a big company. I cannot make a change in the table and when I ask him, he says, "OK, next Thursday, we'll meet, we'll talk about it." That's the beauty of a small  company engagement.	NULL
4640	I'll add all these to the list, as soon as whatever jerk has this thing locked...	NULL
4641	...will unlock it. Miranda, do you have anything else to add while we're...?	NULL
4642	Everyone's covered all the stuff I was thinking. But I do plan on coming up with something else, and just thinking over and seeing if there's something else I can add. But I think Brian, Jasmine, and Karen covered exactly what I was thinking.	NULL
4643	Good. All right, we'll get this codified and make an actual process. All right,  the meeting.	NULL
4644	You just telling Agile jokes now?	NULL
4645	Yeah, I had to get some brownie points back since I was  .	NULL
4646	Actually a lot of people opened up today, that's good.	NULL
4647	Remind me, because that's what Baski said.	NULL
4648	Thanks.	NULL
4649		NULL
4650		NULL
4651		NULL
4652	.	NULL
4653	Oh, OK.	NULL
4654	I can't imagine when. This one is, they're reverse retiring.  . They're writing assets into the 1220 account. That's why it's this many days. Today, if they go...That actually   , can they do this? Search in assets and reverse retirement of 1220.	NULL
4655	Well, let me see if I know what you're talking about. I'm not at all sure. Have I found hardwire? That hardwire? Partially found. That's a hardwire, right?	NULL
4656	He's usually my good one. The one that puts the tasks out there   .	NULL
4657	Yeah, it's all Brian. I sent that email out this morning. I don't know if you looked at it yet. You know that issue where I said it was weird on those ZFR's? There were two audit trail records that flipped it back. It's also doing it when they manually edit stuff on the edit assets screen.	NULL
4658	It wouldn't be treated like take the old one out and replace it with the new one?	NULL
4659	chance to look it. I want to go to Basky, will you note?	NULL
4660	Yes.	NULL
4661	How are they?	NULL
4662	In the middle of the morning. I'm making note of every little, that point area.	NULL
4663	We can look at some of stuff that you come up with. The main thing I want to do is to schedule some time, look at there at least two hours of blocks, sit down and do some of it. I'd never done the fair program.	NULL
4664	I guess it's going to be...	NULL
4665	After you...	NULL
4666	Sorting out?	NULL
4667	Yes. You do an hour. I will do an hour. Then we can see how far we get.	NULL
4668	This is my first point. Big things, so you're going to have to try to bear with me on some things.	NULL
4669	There's no problem. At this point you've been in the code, you know the basics of it, you know how to structure it, and that's a lot more that I can say. Get it to compile. Just cut that variety.	NULL
4670		NULL
4671	Page. I cannot believe I just made a connection between the stuff I did several months ago and then now  . Page. The last name sound familiar, I don't know if it sounds familiar, but I've never met her, I'm kidding.	NULL
4672		NULL
4673	We can't screw anything up. Everything is done at the end and so it's not a concern. As long as you don't check anything in until we've vetted everything.	NULL
4674	Is there a way to save it locally, so that I can just...Is that what he did? I'm new to DFS. I'm terrified.	NULL
4675	You work in your local copy. Everything you have is local. Until you decide to check everything in, you could do whatever you like.	NULL
4676	Great. Thank you.	NULL
4677	Any of the things that Basky's talked about so far. He mentioned creating a new view model for the map provider.	NULL
4678	That would have the red map, only it would be in the license key, and all that?	NULL
4679	Mm-hmm.	NULL
4680	Then you would just exclude the other one that has the map point stuff in it? That's what he said.	NULL
4681	We'll have to eventually, after everything's done, they would remove those references. Delete the references in the modules, the map control and EX map point control, and exclude the map control view .xaml from the project control. That's what I was looking at.	NULL
4682	One of the actual things we could talk about is creating a new view. Basky said we needed to create a new...Call it whatever you want to but we'd call it the Telerik control view, or whatever. That's probably fine, more program.	NULL
4683	Right now, we have the map control view. Most likely can take this straight XAML and the class itself.	NULL
4684	On this page, remove the user control stop, and add the reference, or just drop in the Telerik control. We're going to input the same items here.	NULL
4685	I'm all into it.	NULL
4686	It really looks so easy. I guess I just go over my own thing. I need to  . Not the coating itself, but you know.	NULL
4687	I've never made co-changes in the collate projects. I don't worry about anything. Certainly different so it's coming here and  .	NULL
4688	Let me do it this way.	NULL
4689	Is that how they spell tolerate? Is it right?	NULL
4690	I think so.	NULL
4691	Basically going here, we'll replace, I think kind of shortcut method, but we are going to go in here and replace a lot of the records. Mad control, we are going to create the new Telerik control. I'm going to find a new model. Chill a little bit.	NULL
4692	Let's  where we start coding.	NULL
4693	That's fine.	NULL
4694	Go back and mark prints the view model.	NULL
4695	OK. We have new view. A couple of more changes left to be made, but this gets it started.	NULL
4696	space there. Figure out where that's defined at.	NULL
4697	Is that the one that kept crashing? The one we opened once, and it crashed. We couldn't get it open, even if...	NULL
4698	It could be. I don't know.	NULL
4699	I know you talked about  .	NULL
4700	Controls.	NULL
4701	that one of them, every time you would open the map controller, it would just close.	NULL
4702	This can go to the right place on the view model. OK. That should be just about it. To replace the...Got to unhook this current user control, and see what it is.	NULL
4703	defined.	NULL
4704	The  face for the  control, it should have...	NULL
4705	I'm sorry. I'm getting familiar with the code as well.	NULL
4706	That's OK, Adam. The other thing...	NULL
4707	It's the first time I looked at the view model. I don't know much about it myself.	NULL
4708	Maybe not much left else to do other than to take the Telerik control, plug it in, and match up some of the interface methods.	NULL
4709	Some  .	NULL
4710	Well...	NULL
4711	Sounds that way, really.	NULL
4712	surely not.	NULL
4713	As soon as I got to do it, 5,000 other things emerge. Hopefully not.	NULL
4714	Trace that. Keep creating that, so the typeform has to be XA6. OK, so get field. I'm  , yeah?	NULL
4715	All right, so basically, my understanding is -- limited understanding -- going to take that line out. We'll plug in our Telerik control and that will be the bulk of the work, then trying to figure out mapping the actual functionality, let's wait them out.	NULL
4716	If  well we also got to take it in, this is just a troll. We've created troll and now we've got to go find the user interface aspect of it. With map control view is referenced and what this...	NULL
4717	Do you think you can find an example of where the Telerik control is referenced?	NULL
4718	I know possibly under where some of the geo doc and stuff would be...referenced  , I'm not sure. I never look around and find it all there.	NULL
4719	Free  run as administrator. It's one problem I had I ran to several times to stop from...not always. In 2013, run as administrator. I had to do that  immediately this projects.	NULL
4720	So basically we have is to get our user control complete, so it's not our whole line. Change that one line of code and then do the smart thing and look the JR and collect project and see. I guess, compared against that, make sure we've done some place over there.	NULL
4721	I can get on that. That's the  .	NULL
4722	I don't know what's going on, still opening.	NULL
4723	OK. It's up there. I don't know what it's going on here.	NULL
4724	It's OK. It's up in my screen, so I can check it out there.   .	NULL
4725	Let's see. This point, we've got a view model, we've got a view. We've got update drop control in and then tomorrow we can work on the rest of it.	NULL
4726	I'll see how much I've found today, and hope we'll give us a...	NULL
4727	I've only got a little bit left on LCAM, I've probably got another hour or two to finish that up. There's so much for that, then I can actually look at this code and give  . Then I'll start again tomorrow because I think that's it. We have a few more hours on the LCAM.	NULL
4728	Wait a minute.	NULL
4729	I know. I'm like, "Where did he go?"	NULL
4730	As you move that down...	NULL
4731	Oh, this one here needs to be  .	NULL
4732	some are  .	NULL
4733	Just a little bit better than  . Coding's done. I just need to test it some more. End test, after Grady builds it.	NULL
4734	Oh, OK. Then, you're done?	NULL
4735	Yep. I started on something else already.	NULL
4736	Something else like what?	NULL
4737	Like  screen for the...	NULL
4738	One of their issues from the issues  ?	NULL
4739	Yeah.	NULL
4740	Where's everybody else,  ?	NULL
4741	I'm not sure.	NULL
4742	He just showed up.	NULL
4743	He's been here.	NULL
4744	, right? We had this discussion.	NULL
4745	I didn't make you a bug. Do you want me to move one of these back?	NULL
4746	We'll make a bug.	NULL
4747	I don't want to make a bug. I just want to move these back.	NULL
4748	It doesn't matter. I don't care. There's...	NULL
4749	What's the bug?	NULL
4750	It doesn't work.	NULL
4751	What?	NULL
4752	The grid stuff is just not right.	NULL
4753	There's one bug.	NULL
4754	There's one bug?	NULL
4755	Yeah, there's one bug. The grid stuff is not right, so I don't want to write a bug. It's random, isn't it?	NULL
4756	No, it's not random.	NULL
4757	The drop-downs don't have drop-downs in them, so you can't filter by the drop-downs on the grid.	F
4758	The drop-downs don't have drop-downs in them, so you can't filter by the drop-downs on the grid.	A
4759	You can filter by the drop-downs on the grid.	NULL
4760	Because he's modified it now, because you couldn't yesterday.	NULL
4761	That's  .	NULL
4762	The drop-downs.	NULL
4763	The drop-downs, that's the bug. Those didn't work.	NULL
4764	That's what I said, the drop-downs.	NULL
4765	Did you try it?	NULL
4766	Yeah.	NULL
4767	Did you try real hard?	NULL
4768	You're going to be done with that shortly anyway, right?	NULL
4769	Shortly.	NULL
4770	For real, this time.	NULL
4771	We have check-in that  and I've made changes to that screen too, so if you want...	NULL
4772	You haven't done it since yesterday, though, right? Because it was yesterday after Ethan told me that you had checked your stuff in that I told him about it, and I told him you had already made changes to it so they needed to  . You haven't done since yesterday on that screen, right?	NULL
4773	No.	NULL
4774	You're probably good, because it was after he told me that he had done his stuff that I told  about it,  .	NULL
4775	I have some counts on the headers I'd like to change a little bit, make a little bit more sense about what's in the details and test the duplicate  thing a little more thoroughly just to make sure it's going to reach across different groupings and  . The only thing I haven't started on yet is the multi-row payroll editing.	F
4776	They may not get that. We just may have to move that to the backlog.  "Look, this is what you've got. Now what do you not like?" Because you know they'll come back, and say they don't like something.	NULL
4777	Yeah. I know for sure they're going to come back. There's stuff on the assets screen that they're able to edit but they can't edit on here right now. I know they're going to  .	F
4778	We did have that story in the backlog about adding the ability to mass update, as a whole story. We had that one in the backlog, because Adam had not ever added the...It's like a whole separate story, so we can put this task under that. It's basically the same thing, right?	F
4779	It's exactly the same thing.	NULL
4780	OK. Let's put that under that story. If they whine too much about not being able to mass update, we'll say, "We have a story for that."	NULL
4781	Then I'm just going to do a merge after this, get the code from 109 back to the trunk.	NULL
4782	Good.	NULL
4783	The release tomorrow that's going to them for 1.1, will have everything in it?	NULL
4784	Yes.	NULL
4785	No. I'm done giving them emergency releases. Because if we have to give them one  , it's like, "No, you're just not getting one next week. Deal with it for a week. When you get 1.1, then we'll start back up again."	NULL
4786	We need to run database scripts this evening. I can run that script to update the project ID, to see if the columns are  .	NULL
4787	You didn't do that last night?	NULL
4788	No. I forgot to. I'm sorry.	NULL
4789	Did you run on the SEC stuff last night, when you did the deploy?	NULL
4790	No, I didn't. I forgot that too.	NULL
4791	OK.  I was just asking, so if they ask me I'll know what to tell them next time.	NULL
4792	Throw Grady under the bus this time.	NULL
4793	Yeah. Throw me under the bus.	NULL
4794	If they don't ask, I'm not going to say anything.	NULL
4795	Those fix-it scripts, do those need to be run in our development test environments to bring anything up-to-date, or are those only data changes?	NULL
4796	The one to widen the two project-related fields. Yeah, I need to run that.	NULL
4797	Those should be scripted then?	NULL
4798	Yeah. They're scripted. They're in the 109 script.	NULL
4799	Development?	NULL
4800	I can't remember if I ran that section against dev or not, I'll double-check.	NULL
4801	Do I need it? I think I do. I haven't checked in the merge yet, but when I did I saw everything from 105 to 109 went back to the trunk which I presume has not been run in our dev and test environments yet.	NULL
4802	Not in the test. I haven't deployed in test for a long time. I've been deploying in conversion.	NULL
4803	The only place it's been is that  .	NULL
4804	Next time you do just remember that you have to go back and run all the...	NULL
4805	105 through 109.	NULL
4806	The 1-0whatevers. At least get each of them run once at some point to bring it up to...	NULL
4807	In dev.	NULL
4808	current whatever. The scheme in this introduction.	NULL
4809	My assumption is whoever adds to the database script runs that section that they're adding. They go ahead and do it in dev. That's the assumption I've been going on.	NULL
4810	In dev, that makes sense, but as far as test.	NULL
4811	Right. Whenever we deploy the test then I'll do that.	NULL
4812	As far as I'm concerned you can deploy to test whenever you're ready and we can get back to using...	NULL
4813	Deploy 1.1 test.	NULL
4814	Yeah. For next week...	NULL
4815	when you bring back the database we'll probably take that database and we'll put it on top of my test. That way my test has the latest and we'll quit using the conversion one and we can just go forward from there.	NULL
4816	After he does the merge then I'll deploy the test.	NULL
4817	That's fine, whenever it works for you. If it's one day next week that's fine, because I'll continue to test against conversion until after we get the latest one then we'll drop conversion and go back to using test.	NULL
4818	What I have that we need to talk to them about today. I'm going to ask them what they found out from monitoring the ports because I want to know.  Then the CTDI...	NULL
4819	There's never a dull moment.	NULL
4820	Are you sure you want to know?	NULL
4821	I do, because if we have a problem we need to know, but I don't think we do.	NULL
4822	That's not why you want to know.	NULL
4823	No. It's the second part of that because I don't think we do. I want them to know it's not our problem.	NULL
4824	They don't care.	NULL
4825	I know, I care. Then CTDI and shift two. That's what I have to talk to them about. What do you all have?	NULL
4826	The "ship to," and "ship," that...	NULL
4827	I'm not touching that.	NULL
4828	Code.	NULL
4829	The one they want to load is CLLIs in LCAM?	NULL
4830	Yeah.	NULL
4831	They want to take the location code and...	F
4832	put it in the CLLI field.	NULL
4833	put it in the CLLI field. It's crap.	NULL
4834	I know.	NULL
4835	Use the industry standard.	NULL
4836	I'm talking about the...	NULL
4837	It does work, across applications.	NULL
4838	Fuzzy Logic stuff.	NULL
4839	Yeah, the Fuzzy Logic stuff.	NULL
4840	Can we give that to Kim too?	NULL
4841	He has it.	NULL
4842	He already has the Fuzzy Logic?	NULL
4843	He has it.	NULL
4844	It's in the conversion package.	NULL
4845	The conversion package. They don't understand it, but that's where it is.	NULL
4846	It's somewhere in this  box.	NULL
4847	my hands.	NULL
4848	It's in Arabic too, by the way.	NULL
4849	Upside down and backwards.	NULL
4850	All right it's time to call them.	NULL
4851	Please enter the conference key.	NULL
4852	He doesn't feel good today, so he took the day off and he was already taking tomorrow off.	NULL
4853	tomorrow.	NULL
4854	Hi, who's on the call?	NULL
4855	Jim  .	NULL
4856	Violet.	NULL
4857	Good morning. It's Kim.	NULL
4858	Jim, Violet, and Kim. Anybody else?	NULL
4859	DJ's here.	NULL
4860	I also just got an email this morning that there's another server that has a similar issue, so I'm going to take a look at that and compare and contrast what's happening on our production servers with that server, so...	NULL
4861	Kim when you say...	NULL
4862	it's nice to know we've temporarily fixed what was wrong with our production servers by rebooting them, I don't think that's a long-term solution.	NULL
4863	Kim when you say they're using ports which port is it? Is it connections for the database server, or are they connections for the client Web browser?	NULL
4864	I'm looking at the Web servers and using a tool called TCPView that I downloaded from the Microsoft site, and so it's looking at basically TCP ports.	NULL
4865	Which TCP port, for which service?	NULL
4866	Let's see, does it say?	NULL
4867	If it's HTTP ports, or HTTP traffic, I mean that would help narrow down what the potential problem could be. If it's the ports used by SQL server that could also, that points in one direction or the other, right?	NULL
4868	Right, this particular utility, it tells me what the addresses are that are being attached, so based on that we could probably tell what the local ports are and the remote ports.	NULL
4869	Off the top of my head, if you could narrow it down. Is it network traffic related to the Web servers going to the client, or traffic going back to the database?	NULL
4870	I'm not even sure that this is what caused the issue. But I was tracking some of the errors out of the event log and one of the suggestions pointed me to this utility as a way to monitor. I'm trying to remember.	NULL
4871	I think it actually said that if it ran out of ports it would match up with some of the things that we've been seeing where it appeared to be a network issue, but maybe it's actually not the network maybe it's the interface on the servers running out of resources, making it appear that the issue was a network issue. But as I gather more information I'll let you know.	NULL
4872	OK.	NULL
4873	OK.	NULL
4874	Ask him what's on the other server that you're talking about?	NULL
4875	Pardon?	NULL
4876	What's on the other server that's having similar issues that you were talking about?	NULL
4877	Actually it was one of the disaster recovery servers.	NULL
4878	Right, and so that's what, again, doesn't make any sense and you might want to look at your remedy tickets because it seems like the virtual server for LCAM in Fort Wayne, you just got a remedy ticket on it?	NULL
4879	Yes, that's what I'm looking at.	NULL
4880	Yeah, again, did Roger ever come back to say there was anything else, any other server in that data center that was having issues?	NULL
4881	I chatted with him this morning, I IMd with him this morning and he said that there's nothing else that he's aware of, that he's heard of, or seen that would be similar to what we're experiencing.	NULL
4882	At some point you can certainly get Matt involved, since they're his virtual servers, and ask him to put some resources towards it.	NULL
4883	He contributed a little yesterday. He responded to my email so I plan to pursue this with him too, thanks.	NULL
4884	OK, thank you.	NULL
4885	The other thing that I had on my list was the CTDI interface and the ship to email that came out this morning. I don't know what our options are at this point and we don't have time to make code changes, so I don't think putting the ship to codes in as CLLIs is a viable solution.	A
4886	The other thing that I had on my list was the CTDI interface and the ship to email that came out this morning. I don't know what our options are at this point and we don't have time to make code changes, so I don't think putting the ship to codes in as CLLIs is a viable solution.	F
4887	Yeah, a week-and-a -half, two weeks.	NULL
4888	That they didn't have CLLIs because initially they were thinking that the ship to codes, or the to location codes were CLLIs. But, no we haven't tried to do the Fuzzy Logic Lookup.	NULL
4889	Does Mike  , does he have the complete set of data elements or the Afinium ship to locations that he called a CLLI but it wasn't a CLLI? Does he have that?	NULL
4890	From what I've seen, I've only seen the location code and address. I don't remember anything else from that spreadsheet.	NULL
4891	What do you mean by "address"?	NULL
4892	Cities, states, zip.	NULL
4893	It did have the street?	NULL
4894	I'm pretty sure, but I'll have to look at that spreadsheet again to...	NULL
4895	I think it did from what I remember from what you sent me, it had a street.	NULL
4896	Yes, pretty sure it had the street on there, too.	NULL
4897	I think it had a location name there, too, or something like that.	NULL
4898	Did it?	NULL
4899	That was from CTDI what they got from Afinium? We're talking the same thing, right?	NULL
4900	It was probably on the spreadsheet that Mike sent, I think. Let's see.	NULL
4901	If you're leaving it on me I don't have any options right now. Somebody else can assist. I don't know.	NULL
4902	Yes, I don't know what our options are right now, Jim. Let's see. I'm looking at the spreadsheet. We do have the street address, city, and ship to source code. Wait a minute. Some of these look like CLLIs.	NULL
4903	Yes, some of their location codes they have made look similar to CLLIs. Some of them have underscores in them. Some of them have...	NULL
4904	Like the one example I sent, Marion, Maine, I just picked it because that's where I live, but coincidentally the street address was the same. I know we have all sorts of versions out there so that wasn't meant to act like, "Oh, this is easy to do."	NULL
4905	But Kevin and I went down different paths with some Afinium people but we kept going down these paths, and it's like, there was no table that gave those Afinium ship to type locations tied to anything we could map actually there.	NULL
4906	Even if we put those in...	NULL
4907	I was like you. I was waiting for procurement to come through. I kept thinking, "Well, he must have something." Then Tom's last email was like, "Oh..."	NULL
4908	Even if those do look like CLLIs they still don't have...They don't have the company, like the Afinium company and the OACs.	NULL
4909	We're left with the same situation.	NULL
4910	That's what I mean, that's where we're left.	NULL
4911	It still doesn't help us because it's still going to...	NULL
4912	Right. Exactly, because...	NULL
4913	Yes, they weren't CLLI codes. They had sometimes a full name, sometimes part name, sometimes...Like, Marion had, "Marion 222," on it, because that's the street address, but then those is what we were trying to tie to at least some kind of Afinium company, and that's where we came to dead ends. They don't do that in their world.	NULL
4914	What about a combination of city, state and zip? Would that get us pretty close to an Afinium company?	NULL
4915	I think it would. I'd leave the street address off if you still don't get multiple hits.	NULL
4916	There's two options, maybe three. Somebody goes in and hand-jams brand-new CLLIs for all of these location codes that they've got, and then somebody at CTDI would have to tie those location codes back to the CLLI code change on their part.	NULL
4917	Number two is use some sort of Fuzzy Logic magic to group up data in that spreadsheet to data in LCAM to get a CLLI so that they can map a location code to the CLLI code change on CTDI's part. Or number three, we force all of the location codes into the CLLI field, which probably won't work, because I thought I saw some that were larger than 13 characters, and they don't follow a normal path.	NULL
4918	We may be able to just take the first 11 or 13 of it and have the rest of it in something else, and they would send over the raw location code coaching on our part. There's only three options.	NULL
4919	I do believe...	NULL
4920	Mike was willing, if we could...	NULL
4921	was hoping it just had a one-to-on match to it up-front, before I send it to you.	NULL
4922	What was that, Jim?	NULL
4923	I think Mike  , if we did have the mapping one-to-one for the Afinium location to ship via CLLIs for LCAM I think he was willing to do that on his end up-front.	NULL
4924	If we send a one-time cross...?	NULL
4925	Yeah.	NULL
4926	Could we get the low-hanging fruit right now? There's always going to be...	NULL
4927	What's that?	NULL
4928	Can we get the low-hanging fruit right now? There's obviously going to be some of that stuff matches perfectly, right? Everything matches on address perfectly.	NULL
4929	I don't know how many that would end up being, but that seems like it would be a pretty simple query to perform is just take what we have on that spreadsheet, take what we have in LCAM, do a join based on the address fields.	NULL
4930	There might be 10,000 location codes in there. You might end up with a thousand matches, but at least that's a thousand that you would have that we don't have to look at again. That would be low-hanging fruit to me.	NULL
4931	That could be done by someone else other than you.	NULL
4932	Yes. I'm strapped...	NULL
4933	I know.	NULL
4934	right now. I'm trying to do the Verizon thing.	NULL
4935	Jim, is the list that Mike sent out, is that an exhaustive list? Because he only sent out of 300 and something ship to codes or location codes.	NULL
4936	Let's see. That's the other problem. I'm getting a lot of different lists, working on different projects. What list was that?	NULL
4937	That was an email from...Actually that was from you.	NULL
4938	Initially Mike sent it out. It was called, "Missing," underscore, "CLLI," underscore, "Code."	NULL
4939	I took care of that. That was unrelated. That's another project. Sorry. They sent another one out for me to find the OAC. I was wondering if it was this project, but he clarified it wasn't.	NULL
4940	Oh.	NULL
4941	That's why I was asking earlier, "Have we really ever gotten a complete list so we know what we're dealing with?"	NULL
4942	Do we actually need the list of ship tos and addresses from Afinium?	NULL
4943	He might have the same copy. I'd rather get it from him if that's where we're...	NULL
4944	That makes sense, because it's his data.	NULL
4945	That's fine.	NULL
4946	He gets it from Afinium. He's already been set up with Afinium for a while.	NULL
4947	We need to get that list, and then if we can do like Brian said, just be able to get an exact match on the address information, then we can find the CLLI based on that. I don't know how many would be an exact match versus ones that are close.	NULL
4948	Yes, if you had his list, say the primary fields are the Afinium locations, of whatever they call it, ship to, and then the address, city, state, zip code, and I liked Brian's first suggestion if you just go by the city, state, zip code and then maybe list them all side by side, and then the ones that match versus the ones that didn't, we could possibly get somebody to help manually do some of those to at least get started.	NULL
4949	Or if your first pass is with the city or the address, then the second pass leave that out and see if it's close. Does Afinium or LCAM, what's your quantity of ship via CLLIs?	NULL
4950	I don't know how many we have.	NULL
4951	That's a good question.	NULL
4952	I was just looking at that.	NULL
4953	Let me get with Mike. I'll have him send what he has. If he doesn't then I'll have to get with Afinium's whole team to see if we can get what they have.	NULL
4954	If you can get that to us as soon as you can then we'll go from there.	NULL
4955	All right.	NULL
4956	OK. I guess if we're through talking about that the third thing on my list was...I don't know. I heard somebody else join. Was that Ron, by any chance? OK, I guess not. The Shields interface stuff I know Brenda sent another email this morning, and we've looked briefly at that.	NULL
4957	All those shipments for new equipment yesterday that came from Shields were sent as good equipment. This morning they started sending new equipment as "adds," like they should be. The stuff that Brenda sent the emails about this morning that we'll have to clean up to get them to go into LCAM.	NULL
4958	Who does the clean up?	NULL
4959	We do.	NULL
4960	OK. I couldn't remember.	NULL
4961	It'll be me, or Adam, or Grady. One of us will be working on that.	NULL
4962	He didn't set it up yet?	NULL
4963	Well, apparently he did it maybe instead of...I thought it was supposed to be the night before last at midnight, but apparently that didn't happen, and maybe it happened last night at midnight, because we did see some that came in early this morning that were adds and that's as far as we got to look.	NULL
4964	Yes, the first ones came in about 4:28 this morning Central. I don't know which time zone that is, but 4:28 this morning was when the first new equipment message was received.	NULL
4965	All right. OK.	NULL
4966	Yes, so we'll work on cleaning up those previous ones that they sent that were sent with incorrect information, and anything from today forward we can hope that it's working correctly.  Like I said, we haven't had a chance to follow it all the way through and make sure, but it did create assets.	NULL
4967	The assets are getting written on, the ones I've checked. Even the one we looked at this morning, it did get written on.	NULL
4968	OK. I must have been putting in the pin wrong.	NULL
4969	Good.	NULL
4970	, but so far, things are getting written on as expected.	NULL
4971	I guess that was the last really untested part of the interface that we had. Right now we can cross our fingers and say that we're good with that interface.  We think we're good with that interface, anyway. That was all I had on my list. Did you all have anything that we needed to talk about this morning?	NULL
4972	A couple of days?	NULL
4973	we're not going to have the data until after the 2nd.	NULL
4974	Oh my God.	NULL
4975	We would be starting either very late on the 2nd or early on the 3rd of April.	NULL
4976	What I had on April 1st was that you would cut off access to LCAM so that we could do a backup of your production database, and then LCAM would remain down until all the conversion was done. Is that not the plan?	NULL
4977	We're actually not going to get the data until maybe early on the 3rd. There's really no reason to take down the database on the 1st...	NULL
4978	Let's back up a little bit, because...	NULL
4979	on the application.	NULL
4980	It's 12 hours' worth of work.	NULL
4981	No. We don't care.	NULL
4982	I don't have an issue with that.	NULL
4983	It's just going to take us that many hours to do the work. You tell us...	NULL
4984	you and Larry and Kim think about that.	NULL
4985	What she's saying will help us out, so...	NULL
4986	Yeah.	NULL
4987	It will help us out.	NULL
4988	Jim you have to drop  , so do you want to weigh in on that?	NULL
4989	That's why I put it that way.	NULL
4990	. Kim, what do you think the issues are, taking it down? We asked for techs to be available on Saturdays, and they say they do not schedule work on Saturdays. Unless Jim or Larry or our team's going to be in there on Saturday, I don't see...	NULL
4991	When we did a look at the data that was falling into  , I haven't looked at the data falling into LCAM, but nearly every Saturday and Sunday, weekend days, and even sometimes holidays, we saw transactions falling into  from people doing scanning.	NULL
4992	No, they weren't, because we will turn them off.	NULL
4993	It was very much reduced from the weekdays, but there were still some transactions.	NULL
4994	I think to DJ's point, by stopping on Friday afternoon, it allows us to get about half of the work that we have to do done Friday evening instead of eight hours or nine hours of work, total, that we have to do...If we don't bring it down on Friday night, and we can't bring it down until Saturday, you're not going to be back up Monday morning, because it takes us longer. The hours are on there.	NULL
4995	ISO43, like at 4:00 PM Pacific...Anyway, it doesn't matter. I don't think it's any big deal. I'll check with Jim, because he has a drop. At this point, Susan, just plan on having it by 5:00 PM Pacific on the 1st.	NULL
4996	OK. Kim, will you be able to do the, I think it was step seven?	NULL
4997	He probably doesn't know...	NULL
4998	Which is the scripts.	NULL
4999	Sure, I can run the scripts. Are they scripts that I need to create, or scripts that you're creating and you just need me to launch?	NULL
5000	If it's possible, if I can give you those scripts, that would be a great help to me, a great benefit to me, to get you to run those on your network, without actually having to have a VPN established. Or, if you could point me to a...	NULL
5001	Yes, that's something I can do.	NULL
5002	database server that I can remote into and execute the scripts, I could do that as well. The main thing I'm trying to get around is having a VPN drop and the extract stop.	NULL
5003	Yes, I can do that.	NULL
5004	Thank you very much.	NULL
5005	Thanks. For now, we'll just assume that schedule is good enough. If something comes up and changes that, then you all just let us know, and we'll go from there. Anything else we need to talk about? I know it's been a long call, but we have a lot going on.	NULL
5006	Yeah, Susan, no rush on the email I sent yesterday for the change request. I know they want to take their time and do it right and give as correct an estimate as possible. We did our best-guess scenario, and that's all we could do. I wanted to let you know not to have to push that through faster than they wanted to do it.	NULL
5007	I know, and I did not expect the window to close that quickly. I should be getting used to it, I should be used to it, but I keep thinking something's going to change. But don't worry about it.	NULL
5008	OK, thanks. Anything else anybody had? No? All right, thanks, everybody.	NULL
5009	Have a good day.	NULL
5010	Bye.	NULL
5011	Did she give you that template data or anything?	NULL
5012	Oh, OK.	NULL
5013	I can't imagine when. This one is, they're reverse retiring.  . They're writing assets into the 1220 account. That's why it's this many days. Today, if they go...That actually   , can they do this? Search in assets and reverse retirement of 1220.	NULL
5014	Well, let me see if I know what you're talking about. I'm not at all sure. Have I found hardwire? That hardwire? Partially found. That's a hardwire, right?	NULL
5015	He's usually my good one. The one that puts the tasks out there   .	NULL
5016	Yeah, it's all Brian. I sent that email out this morning. I don't know if you looked at it yet. You know that issue where I said it was weird on those ZFR's? There were two audit trail records that flipped it back. It's also doing it when they manually edit stuff on the edit assets screen.	NULL
5017	It wouldn't be treated like take the old one out and replace it with the new one?	NULL
