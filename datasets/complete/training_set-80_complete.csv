"3602","Yes, that's what it sounded like to me, too.

"774","I don't either.","NULL"
"1443","All right. Bye.","NULL"
"43","So I think there will be something like managers and maybe something like, um, uh, super admin.","F"

"4423","The problem Michael also mentioned was regardless if we flipped all this to say, always use map files, the program still not going to want to implement what is installed. It's not just copy and paste like you originally said, I guess.","NULL"

"334","Um, maybe we could do it that way.","NULL"
"473","But on the other side, who wants to fill out the questionnaire, which takes roughly 30 minutes?","NULL"
"4439","Yeah. I can do that, going to get things going. You said David installed that, or who installed that for you?","NULL"
"3983","As opposed to going Search, select that, put it in your criteria, then click the tab, and it shows you the map.","NULL"
"3102","No, these are showing you,  , because it's going to be the same thing as what...","NULL"

"4986","Yeah.","NULL"
"4880","Yeah, again, did Roger ever come back to say there was anything else, any other server in that data center that was having issues?","NULL"

"4820","Are you sure you want to know?","NULL"
"4988","Jim you have to drop  , so do you want to weigh in on that?","NULL"
"42","And depending on your user role, you have different rights.","F"
"3977","The way I would see some of these things is if you think about a Web page you can move, it can collapse the search criteria, or you can collapse your saved searches. You can bring down the list versus the map.","NULL"

"447","So where were we?","NULL"
"2410","We probably aren't shipping to them, but I'm not sure all the intricacies between  and G teams, and how G teams was handling that. I haven't looked at the G teams data, either. Brian, have you been looking at the G teams data?","NULL"
"801","That would be in line with trying to give direction to new hires about where they need to invest their time, what type of technologies that you should probably be focusing on. That would feed in with our organizational goals as well.","NULL"

"3901","Open the conversation from there, but you can't just go search for conversations that you want and you can't go show those conversations on the map.

"1134","Best of both worlds is, Baski can do that within Notify, not a Windows app. Did you ever look at that, Baski?","NULL"
"1713","Why?","NULL"
"2272","Because you know, we do have this core value about being driven and wanting to grow and wanting to expand our knowledge in anything I guess, and I guess it doesn't necessarily have to be  , you could just be technology thing, it could be application thing, it could be 'I want to know more about how nuts and bolts and  works.'
