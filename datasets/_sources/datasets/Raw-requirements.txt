The point of the project is that it will digitize barcode for all UCL people input moving it away from a manual system. 
The indication of user positions be standardized and clear from the cards. Orange for staff, green for grads. Indicator is on the top, to visually see user statuses physically from the card, which is important e.g., for when they borrow from soas.
Explored possibility of replacing sentry with the general campus cardax system. 
The expiry date on student cards are 3 months longer than they should be (x)
As a run-up to RALIC, the library automatically downloads staff and student data so that there were records in there to import the barcodes into.
