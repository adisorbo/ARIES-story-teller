1	Let's do it.	NULL
2	I know.	NULL
3	Uh, let me just quickly get my notes.	NULL
4	Um, I will, if it's all right with you guys, I will just give you a quick overview, but what has been going so far and I will be needing your inputs on, on, on the specific requirements.	NULL
5	I mean, you have already seen the email probably about, um, the, this tool we are planning to create, right?	NULL
6	Yeah.	NULL
7	So let me just quickly.	NULL
8	Wait, wait.	NULL
9	Oh yeah.	NULL
10	Okay, cool.	NULL
11	Cool.	NULL
12	But I can, yeah.	NULL
13	Yeah.	NULL
14	Right.	NULL
15	So let me quickly get my notes.	NULL
16	Where the hell did I put my, um, my notes?	NULL
17	Where, where is Tanzil?	NULL
18	Isn't he joining the meeting today?	NULL
19	No, he is not.	NULL
20	I think we agreed that we were going to do this on our own, the three of us.	NULL
21	Uh, this information didn't reach me, but, uh, that's fine with me.	NULL
22	Well, it was decided yesterday.	NULL
23	Oh yeah, right.	NULL
24	Sorry.	NULL
25	I haven't seen this email.	NULL
26	Um, so yeah.	NULL
27	Um, yeah, right.	NULL
28	So did you receive that, uh, initial project document to which I've sent you?	NULL
29	Just, uh, the one that briefly describes our mission about this project.	NULL
30	The word document you mean?	NULL
31	Yeah.	NULL
32	Exactly.	NULL
33	You'd have to tap into this a bit.	NULL
34	Yeah.	NULL
35	Cool.	NULL
36	So yeah, I mean that overall wish actually is to extend our, um, services, you know, as for now our costumer mainly, um, fill out service your post or over the, um, portal, which we've set up last year.	NULL
37	But now we want to have a means that our customers can easily and without much effort create service from wherever they are using their mobile device or also their notebook, whatever, you know, it's just currently in all the survey basis, it's like a trend to ease up the process of creating new service.	F
38	So I think we should, it's really important that we also offer such a service and we already discussed this, the board that this should probably something that can be used as a software, as a service where we have customers, they would just sign up to our application, pay a fee.	F
39	We have really staffs how this payment bottles should work, but it should be a recurring payment model.	F
40	So they just sign up in order to use the services and, um, the service as itself.	F
41	It's like, um, an online application that has different user roles.	F
42	And depending on your user role, you have different rights.	F
43	So I think there will be something like managers and maybe something like, um, uh, super admin.	F
44	So this will be asked.	NULL
45	I mean, we need some, some, uh, sort of, um, possibility to manage this entire tool.	F
46	Right.	NULL
47	Um, by the way, why super admin?	NULL
48	I mean, is there a regular admin?	NULL
49	No, actually there, there isn't, I mean, super admin.	NULL
50	It's just, yeah, it's just a word we came up with actually, because as we see it, a costumer has something like an admin, but I probably wouldn't call it admin, but more like maybe project manager, you know.	F
51	So like the project manager is the admin of his own business?	F
52	Yeah, exactly.	NULL
53	If you have a business hierarchy of a bit of, of a specific company, then let's say the top manager board, they will typically, some of them are maybe only one of the top managers will be the project manager of a project because he will sort of manage all the subordinates business units.	F
54	Yeah.	NULL
55	That makes sense.	NULL
56	Okay.	NULL
57	Yeah.	NULL
58	Um, yeah, exactly.	NULL
59	So, I mean, of course there are like you have to properly already, um, think of how, how we possibly can reflect such a hierarchical, um, role system in a technical way.	F
60	Right.	NULL
61	Because we really need to think about how, um, to distribute rights in order to, to only show specific information to specific roles.	F
62	Yeah.	NULL
63	I don't think that should be that much of a problem.	NULL
64	I mean, you, you, you create you in internally, you created a different users with which you can assign some, some specific role.	F
65	Then on, on the front end side, you can simple check on with which users, uh, you are logged in currently, which roles they have, and then you can simply for each element checked through for which roles it should be displayed.	F
66	Okay.	NULL
67	Yeah, I think so too.	NULL
68	I think it's more important that we actually talk about the different roles too.	F
69	I mean, do you have the overall idea of the, of the project, right?	NULL
70	I don't have to explain what it, what it will do in the end, right?	NULL
71	Or do you have any questions just before we go into detail now, do you guys have any questions overall?	NULL
72	Uh, for me, I think it's clear.	NULL
73	There's just some, some small stuff that we need to specify, but, uh, I think that's the reason why we have this meeting in the end.	NULL
74	Yeah.	NULL
75	Um, from my side, I think it is mostly clear.	NULL
76	I mean, this is, as you said, a, a tool for, for survey management or like creation and organization and reporting.	F
77	Um, yeah, I think, I think I got, I got most of the parts, so let's, let's start.	NULL
78	And if there are questions we'll go with.	NULL
79	Yeah.	NULL
80	So yeah, that, that's fine.	NULL
81	Okay.	NULL
82	So maybe let's start with the, with the user roles.	F
83	So, um, typically the company there will be, uh, like our manager, like, uh, some sort of top manager, maybe, I don't know, maybe a project manager will be suitable word.	F
84	Uh, let me just quickly write this down here as a side note.	NULL
85	Maybe we can talk about the naming later on.	NULL
86	By the way you guys can, can you, I hear some really strange noise in the back.	NULL
87	Sounds like a bird.	NULL
88	Yeah.	NULL
89	Uh, this, my mother [inaudible], um, she's finished in two minutes.	NULL
90	Should I, uh?	NULL
91	That's no problem.	NULL
92	No, no, that's okay.	NULL
93	Maybe it's just simply, can you mute your mic if you're saying something?	NULL
94	Oh yeah.	NULL
95	Um, so yeah, like, uh, maybe we, we have this top manager, the project manager, and then typically in the company, we would also have like sub sub-ministries, right.	F
96	Like maybe a team miniature or some sort of friend business unit manager.	F
97	So I don't know how have you got, see, but I think it's quite important that we specify how many abstraction levels of roles we want.	A
98	Depends on what they should be able to do.	NULL
99	Yeah.	NULL
100	How much is there to abstract?	NULL
101	Yeah.	NULL
102	I mean, only the managers are allowed to actually run a survey.	F
103	So, um, for a project manager, he should be able to run surveys to all of the business, including all of the employees and stop or didn't managers such as maybe possible team and actress should only be able to create service including their own team and maybe some organic teams, you know how I mean?	F
104	Um, so I wonder, I wonder if, if it makes sense that, that a project manager should be able to also see and maybe even be able to add it surveys from managers below him, or should he just exclusively, um, be able to manage his own service?	F
105	I'm not really sure here.	NULL
106	Maybe we have to think about this.	NULL
107	Do you think this will be a big problem in terms of, um, um, technique, you know, programming?	NULL
108	I think programming wise, it would be the same thing as interest checking for the role and that, that should not be the problem.	NULL
109	Um, I'm, I'm thinking more of a, of a usage issue.	NULL
110	I mean, depending on how big this entire thing gets, maybe he simply has too many surveys to manage and loses track of what is important.	F
111	What if he has every survey available?	F
112	Yeah.	NULL
113	Right.	NULL
114	Maybe, I don't know.	NULL
115	Maybe Mark, you can get some important because you have probably the best knowledge about user experience.	NULL
116	I think it's really important that we come up with a neat design where let's say a project manager, he can feel there and he can also customize his, um, dashboard.	F
117	So as to only see, what's really important for him to see at this very moment, but if you want to, can see all.	NULL
118	Yeah, I think this would be a good approach.	NULL
119	So, uh, I think he should be able to see all the, uh, the surveys from the normal metrics by business unit.	F
120	And, um, he can filter them.	NULL
121	Maybe we can also add some texts to the, to the, to the surveys for easy filtering or something like that.	F
122	How, how do you mean text?	NULL
123	I don't really understand this.	NULL
124	Um, like, um, the, the content of the survey, so maybe it's about employee happiness or customer satisfaction, and we can use texts.	F
125	Would that be a fully customizable tag or predefined texts?	F
126	Uh, I didn't get to think about this, but probably predefined would be easy to manage.	F
127	You can select of a certain group.	F
128	You're maybe, maybe we can say the project manager can define these texts for his company.	F
129	So yeah, that would make sense.	NULL
130	Yeah.	NULL
131	The team leaders or the employees could, could simply select out of these predefined tags.	F
132	Yeah.	NULL
133	Yeah.	NULL
134	Okay.	NULL
135	Maybe this, this is a good point because maybe we, as a, as a developer of the software could also offer like predefined accents, which I don't know, apply to some sort of best practice or make it increase the usability and also sell these kinds of pack.	NULL
136	I mean, this is just one example, but let's sort of sell predefine them project setups to our customers.	F
137	Yeah.	NULL
138	This could be quite interesting.	NULL
139	I'm not going to talk you out of it because you're, you're the business leader on this, but just think about the generalization, if, if it, if it is possible, if it makes sense?	NULL
140	But I get your point on that.	NULL
141	Technically it should be possible to do so.	NULL
142	Yeah.	NULL
143	Right.	NULL
144	Well, I think that the more we can generalize the better, right?	A
145	Because we need, I mean, you know, you work now in our business for quite a while, both of you, so, you know, the set of customers you already have.	NULL
146	I mean, we ha we, we don't, we have a lot of customers, but it's still quite, um, well, it's, we, we don't serve the whole world.	NULL
147	So I think maybe, yeah, maybe it will make sense to sort of come up with the generalized, um, set of texts.	A
148	But I mean, I already liked the idea of text.	NULL
149	Anyway, I know that this data, we can go into more detail on this later on.	NULL
150	I think that's already quite a good input.	NULL
151	Okay.	NULL
152	I mean, there, there will also of course be this, the role of the employee or of the servery filler him or herself, right.	F
153	Because let's say a manager runs the survey, so you will receive the survey in some form and then be able to fill it out.	F
154	I'm wondering, do you think it is necessary for users to even have like a in or something?	NULL
155	Or how could we, how could we solve this with the survey feeling?	NULL
156	How do you have any ideas on how we could actually bring the survey to the employees on a most simple way?	NULL
157	Yeah.	NULL
158	If I can talk here, maybe we could just send them an invite by email, like on the company email or an internal email?	F
159	So they have an account, but they never, uh, they never, they don't have access with this account to the, to our tool.	F
160	So they're just having an account such that, uh, the managers can send them, uh, uh, emails, you know what I mean?	F
161	What I want to say.	NULL
162	But just so that I understand you right, so that as a user, I don't really have to, um, log in or anything?	F
163	I will just get an email?	F
164	Uh, yeah, exactly.	NULL
165	Ah, okay.	NULL
166	So the manager will actually create this user and then the user is sort of in the system and will receive the emails on the email address which the managers specified.	F
167	Yeah.	NULL
168	That's what I meant.	NULL
169	Do we, do we actually have to assign specific users as in, uh, on the platform?	NULL
170	If, if you're talking about, we simply send an email, I mean, you could just, um, specify a list of emails and that's fine.	F
171	We already have that, but two, we actually need to have underlying users.	F
172	I mean, are there additional configuration issues or any other thing that we would require users for?	NULL
173	Yeah.	NULL
174	Maybe what's important is, uh, I mean, we have some customers with different which are based in different countries, right.	NULL
175	So we also have to consider language settings for users. I'm not really sure how we could address this problem.	A
176	I mean, actually I really like what Mark said.	NULL
177	I mean, yeah.	NULL
178	So, so that the user doesn't have to anything, he will just be added by the manager to this project.	A
179	And as soon as this happened, he sort of maybe gets a email that says Hey, welcome to the, to this, uh, project.	A
180	And from there on, he will receive mails, but all this language setting stuff, maybe shouldn't concern that the user, I mean, with user, I mean the survey filler, right?	NULL
181	Like an employee or what do you think?	NULL
182	I think Mark, you, you, you have the right track on this.	NULL
183	Yeah.	NULL
184	I think that's what you just said.	NULL
185	Chris makes, makes a lot of sense because of the stuff you mentioned.	NULL
186	So from a technical point of view, Janik, it will be probably easiest that way, right?	NULL
187	Because then we don't have to manage like, see, a thousands and billions of user accounts.	NULL
188	Yeah.	NULL
189	Well, with the user accounts that is actually I think more ideal because then we can actually like pinpoint to specific users and it's not an email floating around somewhere.	NULL
190	So I think, I think, but what Mark was trying to say is that the, the, the simplicity of simply getting an email for the employee, that should be fine because, uh, if, if the project manager or the team leader simply specifies which users to tag in this, um, in this survey and say, or she's simply addressed by their email, that is fine.	F
191	Uh, I was, as I said, I was just worried about, uh, other other stuff, except from the simple may listing.	NULL
192	Concrete example.	NULL
193	Yeah.	NULL
194	Maybe, maybe the, the language settings, as you said, or maybe he belongs to different business units.	NULL
195	So we would need, uh, maybe this part.	NULL
196	So as to assign, um, which team leader can interact with which employees, so where, where does, where do they belong in, in the hierarchy or maybe even from the project manager side, uh, which team leaders belong to this, uh, project manager.	F
197	And this again would be like a hierarchy that we will have to store and to represent somewhere.	A
198	I mean, just to keep it as simple as possible, I would just say a project manager is always top level.	A
199	So every other user and team leader belongs to a project manager.	A
200	Nonetheless, Is there just a single one or are there multiple?	NULL
201	We could talk about, I think there should be the possibility to have multiple.	A
202	So they are just all on the top level and its like a pool of project managers and the top level and out of this pool, those, the entire structure or hierarchy of the business.	A
203	Okay.	NULL
204	But you would not assign to specific project managers or would you?	NULL
205	Nah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do this at the initial, at this point of phase one of our project, because I think we should keep it simple.	NULL
206	I mean, what, what are the odds that, that accompany assigned smokable project managers to such a survey tool anyways, right.	NULL
207	Normally you would have like at most, maybe one project manager, which corresponds or communicates with the human resources department of the business and that's about it, right.	NULL
208	You don't need a lot of, I mean, we, we talk, um, top level managers of a business here probably to be overkill if, if a business would have more than one managing this, this, this little, um, aspect of the business, right.	NULL
209	Yeah.	NULL
210	Yeah.	NULL
211	Certainly depends on, on which exact client we're talking about.	NULL
212	But I think I get you a general concept.	NULL
213	Yeah.	NULL
214	Okay.	NULL
215	So apart from, from the, from the mailing list, um, which Mark, uh, mentioned, what else is there?	NULL
216	I mean, are there specifics we, we need to discuss or that they're unclear or.	NULL
217	Yeah, I mean that, there are a lot of unclear, um, topics still.	NULL
218	I mean, we just talked about those now more or less, but I mean, and, and also now about the communication, so just let me briefly get, um, pinpoint this down.	NULL
219	So I would really like it, if an employee doesn't have to do any, it doesn't have to do anything to, to be part of a project.	A
220	This is solely the, um, the task of a manager.	A
221	So, uh, let me just quickly write this down here.	NULL
222	Um, yeah.	NULL
223	So, um, then we also have to think about the surgery itself.	NULL
224	I mean, let's say a manager, a manager creates a survey.	NULL
225	Um, we have to think about how this technically should work such a survey, right.	NULL
226	What kind of question makes sense in it?	NULL
227	I mean, we could probably just stick to our, to our typical survey model where we have scale questions with, with disliking scale and we have open tax questions and we have multiple and single choice questions, right.	F
228	Well, I would pitch put, I would pitch this to the creativity department.	NULL
229	What kind of, what kind of questions are there?	NULL
230	What looks fancy?	NULL
231	Yeah, we need something fancy looking and also something innovative.	A
232	I mean, the types of questions I just mentioned there, everyone knows them, but maybe we could come up with something innovative, which will be a unique selling point for our application.	NULL
233	Um, I cannot hear you both.	NULL
234	I think you're both muted, but maybe, maybe, so maybe Mark, can you hear me now?	NULL
235	Perfect.	NULL
236	Um, yeah, I noted some types of questions here in preparation for this awesome meeting.	NULL
237	So first, uh, I would, I thought about open text questions.	F
238	Like everybody knows them, uh, of course single and multiple choice questions, and maybe we can also add something like swipe questions so that you can have maybe a left-hand side, the right-hand side and a button bottom side.	F
239	And there's the question.	NULL
240	And maybe the left side is no, the right is yes.	F
241	At the bottom side is, I don't know, or I don't care.	F
242	And then, uh, one can take the, the question that is depicted like a card and can just swipe it to the area wherever you want.	F
243	How, how would you solve this if someone uses a traditional computer or notebook?	A
244	I mean, without touch functionality.	NULL
245	Yeah.	NULL
246	You can just use the mouse cursor and drag the cart to the, to the area.	A
247	Cool.	NULL
248	Could we just also like make, make the, the side thingy a button like that you could just, instead of swiping also just click there.	NULL
249	Yeah.	NULL
250	Okay.	NULL
251	Yeah, that, that allows us particularly because yeah, it's made me more intuitive for, for P for computer users using a mouse.	A
252	But, but we would have to, to, to maybe restrict that on the mobile devices.	A
253	Yeah, no, no, no, not the swipe, but the click, you mean that you accidentally clicked somewhere.	NULL
254	Right.	NULL
255	Okay.	NULL
256	So on mobile devices, you can only swipe using the touch functionality.	A
257	Yeah, yeah.	NULL
258	That makes total sense actually, but yeah.	NULL
259	Would be nice.	NULL
260	Yeah.	NULL
261	Just to finish my thing, sorry.	NULL
262	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	NULL
263	Because this is already really, it was just a really idea actually.	NULL
264	Yeah.	NULL
265	Just a quick input.	NULL
266	I mean, I don't know how, you know, the functionality, but sometimes if you just try swiping through and then you realize, Oh, that was the wrong side.	NULL
267	Is there intended to be a functionality to retrieve a card?	F
268	Yeah.	NULL
269	I think we should add this because, or we should add something like in the end, uh, the questions can be pre viewed again before submitting.	NULL
270	So like the answers, Hey, that's what you answered to use submit this.	NULL
271	Exactly.	NULL
272	Okay, yeah, yeah.	NULL
273	That's, that will be really important there.	NULL
274	Hm.	NULL
275	Okay.	NULL
276	Yeah, I like that.	NULL
277	Yeah.	NULL
278	That's actually a really cool idea, but the answer yeah.	NULL
279	Bring your others as well.	NULL
280	It's the scale question, like some engagement questions and like that, uh, they can only be used to measure engagement or engagement related topics.	F
281	But maybe I have, yeah.	NULL
282	I think I already mentioned something about the engagement in the project description, which I've sent you, but I think we shouldn't go too much in depth with engagement at this point, because it's way out of scope for this first phase.	NULL
283	So, okay.	NULL
284	Yeah.	NULL
285	I should've mentioned this earlier, sorry, but maybe, maybe less about the, the actual functionality and more about the design will be really nice.	NULL
286	You know, like I would really like it if you have something like they have on Reddit or somewhere like where you could maybe also as a, you somehow have to involve the users into the survey.	F
287	They should not just be there in click to questions they should of bringing in their own ideas, which in turns can then be seen by other users.	F
288	And maybe, I don't know, you know, where.	NULL
289	So you mean like in the end of the survey, you can have, uh, some of that somewhat the first question creator and, uh, the, the guys of the survey of the guys that they decided to be off, the roads can agree to this or, or something like that.	F
290	Yeah.	NULL
291	Um, yeah, I'm not sure we somehow have to include that the ideas of, of the survey fillers and then these ideas can sort of be displayed to all the other people that are part of the survey.	A
292	And these people can then decide if these are good ideas or not.	NULL
293	So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.	F
294	So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.	A
295	Something like this will be really neat, but I'm not sure if this is way overkill.	NULL
296	So technically, I mean, we, we have a timeframe of around six months for this phase one, so I'm not sure if this is all working, maybe only you can.	NULL
297	Honestly I cannot say just out of my head, I guess I would have to like do that.	NULL
298	Um, I think just for the technical side, it should, of course be possible, but I'm not sure about budget or time scope.	NULL
299	Just, just to clarify this, this, if I understood this correctly, this is about users pitching new survey questions.	NULL
300	No, not really survey questions and more well let's, let's give me, let's give you a concrete example.	NULL
301	Let's say more like a general feedback box.	NULL
302	Exactly.	NULL
303	But not channel it's channel in terms of the survey, let's say a survey is about user satisfaction or umm, employee motivation.	NULL
304	I'd say it's about employee motivation.	NULL
305	So the manager wants to find out how motivated his team is at this very moment.	F
306	So the questions evolve around motivation.	A
307	Maybe he asks them what motivates you most at work.	NULL
308	So the users should have the possibility to bring in their own ideas, should the manager have missed them.	F
309	So maybe me as a user can just submit that.	F
310	Um, yeah.	NULL
311	I don't know, the espresso machine motivates me the most at work so I can submit this and then others should see this.	NULL
312	And then maybe the teams like, Oh yeah, we all need the espresso machine.	NULL
313	That's a great idea.	NULL
314	And others have have also this, this option to, to select or comment on.	F
315	Okay.	NULL
316	So yes, exactly.	NULL
317	But I don't really see how this should be working, right.	NULL
318	Because it should have some oper download functionality attached with that.	F
319	I I'm, I'm not technical enough to see if this is even yeah, if this makes sense.	NULL
320	It's such a comment.	NULL
321	I just see one problem, because if I'm the first one to complete the survey, I won't get to see the questions or the bring ups from the other people that take the survey afterwards.	A
322	True, true.	NULL
323	That's for sure a big problem.	NULL
324	So maybe, yeah.	NULL
325	I don't know.	NULL
326	Maybe we can collect these questions and make us a follow-up survey, which then, or something like that in the end.	F
327	But then you get two emails.	NULL
328	Yeah, yeah.	NULL
329	Well maybe, maybe we could include them in the, you know, at the end of the survey, a report is created out of this survey, which lists the results of the different questions, right?	F
330	So the math, maybe, maybe we put.	NULL
331	Do we have to leave this to the manager?	NULL
332	What Erin, we, in the report, there is a, maybe a dedicated section for a user feedback or user inputs were very conceived for, for which questions, which additional inputs came in.	A
333	And then that then remains the question with, with the voting.	A
334	Um, maybe we could do it that way.	NULL
335	That, yeah, it's just up to the manager, up to the manager to see what came in in this specific survey, right?	NULL
336	So he, at the end, in the report, he sees all the feedback of the users, but then he himself can decide which of these he liked.	A
337	And then he can include this in the followup survey, like Mark mentioned, and in this follow-up survey, the people then get to vote.	F
338	It's like the manager then will be like a first filter that filters out.	F
339	The really unnecessary I listen is in his opinion, from the really nice things which he sees worth sharing.	NULL
340	But then, then I would maybe I know how, how from the, from the UX perspective, this goes, but like simple swipe would not be sufficient for this.	NULL
341	I mean, maybe, maybe you would want to say more to explain on why you like, or don't like this, what, what is there out of your mind?	NULL
342	Is there a, an approach for this?	NULL
343	You can use the Reddit approach again, where you can have comments you can upvote or downvote and then you can.	F
344	Or making maybe, maybe we should just create a new question type.	NULL
345	The question type is it's like an open question texting, but it only serves the purpose for four survey fiddlers to commit their ideas.	NULL
346	So just keep in mind, open text is evil.	NULL
347	As in, if you have simple possibilities, then the processing is also simple.	NULL
348	But if you start with open text, then depends on what you want to do, but maybe you have to go up until natural language processing, which can get quite cumbersome.	NULL
349	No, but I think we sh we wouldn't have to go that far.	NULL
350	I mean, we could just make it so that these ideas are submitted in raw text and then, or displayed and in the report to the manager.	F
351	So the manager sees, okay, user one set, blah, blah, blah, user two set blah, blah, blah, nothing more than that.	NULL
352	And he can select, wow.	NULL
353	Okay.	NULL
354	This idea of user one is nice.	NULL
355	So let's somehow include in the next survey.	NULL
356	That's all, there shouldn't be any, um, post-processing of these ideas.	NULL
357	The reason I am saying this is, I'm not sure if, if we make every question, comment, the bolus you guys suggest to	NULL
358	I was not, I was not talking about every question, but for, for the follow-up survey, but for, for, for when you can like, or dislike, uh, other ideas, or maybe you want to add something to it	F
359	Right.	NULL
360	Or, or explain why you don't like it.	NULL
361	And that was the idea for, for the common box, but not for every question.	NULL
362	The comment box in your, this is question specific, right.	NULL
363	I can say this question should be commented.	F
364	So the comment will be on this question specifically.	NULL
365	Yeah.	NULL
366	Well, I can do that.	NULL
367	Yeah.	NULL
368	Okay.	NULL
369	Yeah.	NULL
370	I mean, I really liked the idea of making questions commendable like that.	NULL
371	Me, I, as a manager can get feedback in whether people liked and understood the question or not.	F
372	I think we accidentally here hit another idea, which I didn't want to, to point at, but I think I would just track this down because I really liked the comment ability of questions, but it still doesn't really solve the problem, which I initially mentioned in as in to include the user.	NULL
373	So he can really add new ideas or innovative ideas, or maybe even this way, patients, which then can generally be seen by others and the opera download it.	F
374	Um, yeah, but maybe, maybe I have to think about this more anyways.	NULL
375	I mean, this is already, you really need degree, the detail work we're doing here.	NULL
376	So I think maybe we should just move on a little bit.	NULL
377	We also need to talk about the reporting specifically.	NULL
378	I mean, now I really liked that here with the swipe question, I, I wrote this down and also to comment the ability of questions.	NULL
379	So people can, if the manager allows command specific questions, which I really liked this skip some sort of inclusion,	F
380	Wait, wait, wait.	NULL
381	If the manager allows, so this is also configurable?	NULL
382	Yeah, it definitely has to be configurable because otherwise let's say I, as a manager, create the survey, complaining five questions.	F
383	So if it's not configurable, so all these five questions can be commendable, right?	NULL
384	So I want to configure it.	NULL
385	Only question three out of five should be commended.	NULL
386	Okay, okay, yep.	NULL
387	I know you're the technician guy here and you can say if this is doable or not, but if we include the commands and functionality, this should be toggle.	F
388	Yeah.	NULL
389	That, I mean, the, the, the functionality itself can, is easily reusable.	NULL
390	If you once built the comment box, you can simply copy paste it from, from your perspective, right?	NULL
391	And then this is a simple flag displayed or not displayed.	F
392	Okay, yeah, okay.	NULL
393	But, but nice to know that it should have this flag.	F
394	Yeah right, yeah, yeah.	NULL
395	I mean, yeah.	NULL
396	I was probably just thinking this for myself, but yeah, that's good that it, that you, yeah.	NULL
397	That we are now found the concepts about this, because this will be a really, really important feature.	NULL
398	Otherwise it would get completely out of hand.	NULL
399	And also the report that results out of survey will be really messed up and bloated with, if every question cook will be commendable, I mean, maybe we can just use this to transition to the reporting system because that's also something which should be like the part of, of course, from an ice service to this, this is really important to, right.	NULL
400	Because the manager, they want to be clean, clean, and easy to understand view what's happening within their survey or what are the results.	F
401	So I'm not sure here how we should actually display the results of these different questions.	NULL
402	Maybe you guys have some ideas, otherwise I'll give you mine.	NULL
403	Um, yeah, I have a small, um, how should I say I thought about this and maybe we talked about the different, uh, types of questions.	NULL
404	So some question types are, um, better to be displayed in a specific way.	NULL
405	I think maybe for the swipe questions, we can have some, some, uh, a bar graph that shows the sides they swiped to.	F
406	And for all the questions we can have all the types, but all in all, I would say for the, um, usability or visibility of the results, it would be good to, to group the question types together.	F
407	What do you think about this?	NULL
408	Just like maybe all the open text questions are grouped together in the report and all other types of questions are also grouped together,	A
409	But what if semantically, they don't fit?	NULL
410	I mean, what if let's, let's say you have, um, out of 10 questions in your survey, you have three questions regarding, uh, let's say communication within the team and these three questions they are related.	NULL
411	But one is a swipe question.	NULL
412	One is an, I don't know, open text question.	NULL
413	And one is, uh, the scale of satisfaction, something.	NULL
414	And now if you propose that they are not, they are not, uh, connected, but they are grouped into their types.	NULL
415	Now as a manager, I would have to, to come and take the information from anywhere, right?	NULL
416	Yeah, totally see this point, maybe Chris, can you elaborate or, okay.	NULL
417	Yeah, I can.	NULL
418	I'm thinking actually, but I, yeah, I haven't really thought about this specific scenario, which is quite an important one.	NULL
419	Maybe, uh, I mean, I think it's important that we have some sort of, which it for each individual question the report and then, um, hold on.	F
420	There's someone calling me,	NULL
421	How's your life going?	NULL
422	Well fine so far.	NULL
423	It's a little early, but I manage.	NULL
424	Stressful day.	NULL
425	It's always.	NULL
426	What about you?	NULL
427	Yes, since I got tested positive.	NULL
428	Oh yeah?	NULL
429	It's really tough when	NULL
430	Yeah, last week, last Friday.	NULL
431	Okay, I didn't know that.	NULL
432	So, so now you're, you're sitting at home enjoying your life or?	NULL
433	Uh, I wouldn't say yeah.	NULL
434	I'm sitting at home all the time	NULL
435	But what about symptoms?	NULL
436	No, nothing.	NULL
437	Yeah.	NULL
438	Maybe a little cough.	NULL
439	My friends it's the only rough, but otherwise probably same as me.	NULL
440	Yeah, yeah.	NULL
441	I thought it was, it was kind of, kind of a joke, but if it weren't for Corona, I would have gone to work without any problems, honestly.	NULL
442	Okay.	NULL
443	All right guys.	NULL
444	Sorry, I'm back.	NULL
445	I, yeah, I really had to take this phone call.	NULL
446	This was important.	NULL
447	So where were we?	NULL
448	We were, yeah, exactly what the reporting.	NULL
449	Well, I think maybe we should, we should limit the service to specific topics, right?	A
450	So it's not really getting messy.	NULL
451	Let's say a survey can only contain so many questions.	A
452	Let's say, I don't know, we have to think about this really detailed afterwards.	NULL
453	So maybe let's say a survey can maximum at the, at the maximum contain 10 questions.	A
454	And then we should probably group not really group the question and group.	NULL
455	Yeah.	NULL
456	We have to group them, but we have to create a single empathy or wait sheet for each question report.	NULL
457	So scale question, one of the reports will get its own, which is fair.	NULL
458	Sorry, scale question.	NULL
459	One of the survey, we will get its own way too in the report.	NULL
460	And then all the other scale questions are in the same area of the report.	F
461	Then we have the same for open text question, multiple single choice and so on.	NULL
462	And then of course, it's, it's the manager who created the survey.	NULL
463	It's, it's his job to make sense out of this data.	NULL
464	I think it's impossible to sort of group the questions by, by meaning of the question for this week.	NULL
465	We will have to include really complicated the algorithms, maybe even NLP or something, which should be way out of scope.	NULL
466	Yeah, I think you're somewhat right.	NULL
467	But normally the questionnaire is already grouped by, by topic, isn't it?	NULL
468	Should be.	NULL
469	Yeah.	NULL
470	Yeah, of course.	NULL
471	And also from a user experience part, and I think the limiting of the questions would not be a good, a good thing because what if you have, for example, 12 questions, so you have to create two different surveys.	NULL
472	This is also a problem with the reports in the end that's they're offering.	NULL
473	But on the other side, who wants to fill out the questionnaire, which takes roughly 30 minutes?	NULL
474	Exactly.	NULL
475	This is the point, which I think Mark, you haven't really understood.	NULL
476	I also didn't.	NULL
477	I really, yeah, I'm really sorry.	NULL
478	No, it's no offense.	NULL
479	I probably forgot to pinpoint this in the project description, but this tool we're creating here, it, this should be like a easy, short thing.	NULL
480	Like otherwise, if someone really wants to create the, in that survey, even use our other services, we have flooded with a lot of them on our home page to create a really full flex drownded survey.	NULL
481	But here it's just together a claims like the manager really wants to fill the polls of his team in a specific topic.	NULL
482	That's also why to be called polls service something, you know?	NULL
483	So these should be quick, quick and reoccurring service.	NULL
484	Not, yeah, yeah.	NULL
485	Yeah, yeah.	NULL
486	Like this, it would totally make sense to limit them to 10 and like this, I think there's also only one topic per, per survey.	NULL
487	So we can, we can group the question types together, right?	NULL
488	That's actually the exact input I was hoping for, because I mean, technically you, if, if within the same survey you have different topics for some reason, technically you could assign ma as in a group to, to the questions so that it would be possible to, to then in the report group by, by these question groups for, for the results.	NULL
489	I don't know how much sense this makes, but I think it, it should be possible from a technical aspect.	NULL
490	So just like to, to Mark different parts of the survey, similar to the tasks, similar to the texts, you, you can create a group and then assign, let's say three questions to this group, but in the entire survey you'll have up to eight questions.	F
491	Yeah, it makes sense.	NULL
492	Yes.	NULL
493	I like this idea, yeah.	NULL
494	I like this idea.	NULL
495	That's, that's something I just noted it down, but something we have to keep in mind and go more into that.	NULL
496	That's that's a really good idea.	NULL
497	What do you guys think about, make about creating an adjustable report?	NULL
498	So the manager can move around the elements as he wants so he can sort of create this own sorting.	F
499	Yeah.	NULL
500	From a UX perspective, this will bring a lot of benefits.	NULL
501	I think, I don't know if the programming part will be a lot more complicated.	NULL
502	I think honestly, I don't know.	NULL
503	I mean, if, if you, if we cook cleanly keep the different clearly keep the different elements and report apart from each other, sort of have different objects of classes.	NULL
504	So it shouldn't be so much of an issue to move these blocks around, right?	NULL
505	It depends on, on how we entirely approach the thing.	NULL
506	I mean, you're right, because the indie individual widgets or, or whatever this is, then they are modular and we can move them without problem.	NULL
507	That what I'm worried about is how, how we are going to represent the state of the overview, as in where, when, how do we define how the report looks, where each widget is placed?	NULL
508	Yeah. I would have that I would have to, to also dive in and, and make an estimation for,	NULL
509	Yeah, right.	NULL
510	I mean, that's, that's good that you mentioned the point of, of, of how it actually should look in there because here, we also have to keep in mind that the design of this tool has to be responsive, right.	A
511	Because it has to be viewable on different devices.	F
512	Then again, customization brings a certain instability to the responsive design, because we can probably not predict how it's going to look.	NULL
513	Okay, I see.	NULL
514	I'm not sure.	NULL
515	Maybe you can grasp this a bit better Janik, but, or maybe also you Mark as a UX specialist,	NULL
516	I would have to collaborate on this, yeah.	NULL
517	I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?	F
518	I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?	A
519	On an iPad, I think, yes.	F
520	I mean, think about, think about the manager who's often walking around or visiting different I don't know, departments, and instead of laptops, they have iPads.	NULL
521	And then there is like a neat dashboard or something that he has on his iPad, which is like some starting screen, or I don't know.	F
522	But certainly it makes sense.	NULL
523	Maybe not the iPhone, but at least the tablets.	F
524	I have, yeah, yeah.	NULL
525	Maybe because you, you need also a good input device, like a keyboard or something, because if you create new employees or new questions, you need to type a bit of text,	F
526	Which would mean it's maybe on two different platforms.	A
527	How do you mean?	NULL
528	So like the, the actual configuration would probably happen on a, on a desktop or laptop, but for, for the single reporting, if you are in a meeting, you have your iPad with you.	NULL
529	Oh, I see.	NULL
530	So you use it just to make the reporting responsive so you can always view what's happening.	F
531	For example,	NULL
532	I like this idea a lot.	NULL
533	I mean, yeah, yeah.	NULL
534	Let me know what this,	NULL
535	I think for the beginning, this would surely be enough.	NULL
536	And if we have time or resources afterwards, in another phase, we can also expand on this.	NULL
537	Yes.	NULL
538	I mean, we can choose an approach, which would make the global possibility for responsive design, but maybe just not in detail implemented on each side.	A
539	Yeah.	NULL
540	I think that's, that's a good, a good way.	NULL
541	And also in the survey interface, you can fill out the questions.	F
542	This should also be specifically responsive so that all the costumers can fill out the surveys wherever they are.	F
543	That's also really important.	NULL
544	Yeah.	NULL
545	I think this, this should definitely be responsive.	F
546	So we have two elements with which for sure need to be responsive, which is the reporting and survey mask.	F
547	Yeah.	NULL
548	That's I think that's that, that would be great.	NULL
549	If we could nail this for phase one, actually, yeah.	A
550	I just put this here in the projects goals, you guys see it in the documents I'll share afterwards, but that's that's yeah, that that's, that would be a really important.	NULL
551	Yeah, so that's	NULL
552	Yeah, yes.	NULL
553	Yeah, please go ahead.	NULL
554	No, it's okay, I'm listening.	NULL
555	I actually have a different question.	NULL
556	I think in the beginning somewhere you were talking about languages two questions, one to the business side, as in what languages are there is there a default language or how, how do we handle this?	NULL
557	Yep.	NULL
558	I think it would make sense to have a default language for approach check.	F
559	So yeah, yeah.	NULL
560	We really have to think about this actually, because my wish needs that it's, that the language can be, or the available language to the project have to be set when we, as a super admin, create the project for a customer, right?	F
561	So we say this project supports English and German and from French.	F
562	Since then I may be a follow-up question if we don't know prior.	NULL
563	Oh, well maybe prior what languages there are the, I have the question of where do the translations come from?	NULL
564	And from previous projects where I think we handled it the way that our client had to provide translations for the languages they wanted, where we just sent them, Hey, there are the terms like the, these these words and sentences.	F
565	Are there, can you translate them?	NULL
566	Would that make sense?	NULL
567	Yeah, I see.	NULL
568	Yeah.	NULL
569	I think that would actually make sense that we keep it like that in this tool as well.	NULL
570	I mean, I was just also the other day I was searching the net and I found DeepL this translation API, and maybe it would also be possible to include some sort of deeper API as in if a manager or now if a user creates an English question, people will automatically translate it to German storing the germ part of this question.	F
571	I'm not sure if this is technically doable, actually,	A
572	I think so, yeah.	NULL
573	But now, well, I would give the admin the possibility to correct the translation at least, but just, just as we clear, we are now talking about two different things.	F
574	One is the interactive part, which should be translated for, for the users between them.	F
575	And what I meant is like the entire GUI, so the, all, all the fixed static texts from menus and that stuff,	F
576	I think they have to be hard coded in different languages actually.	A
577	Yeah.	NULL
578	But that is exactly the problem, because if we don't know the languages they are going to use, we cannot hard-code anything	A
579	Yeah. But, but if we have to limit the language anyway, I mean, look at our customers, we have to.	A
580	No, technically we don't have to, we can hard-code translation, codes, and then simply register translations for these codes.	A
581	I don't know what you mean by that.	NULL
582	Let's say you have the translation code, which should the books scale.	NULL
583	And then for German, you would translate it into one word.	NULL
584	For English you would translate it into a different word and maybe someone wants to do Spanish, but they will have to provide a translation for Spanish, but we can simply register this translation.	F
585	And if the user logs in with a Spanish setting, he will get the Spanish translation for it.	F
586	But this, the Spanish translation has to be valid for all future Spanish companies that join our software as well, right?	NULL
587	Not, not every user has to specify own Spanish translation to be global.	A
588	So once the Spanish has been done.	NULL
589	So for example, scale question is blah, blah, blah.	NULL
590	Then it will be blah, blah, blah, for all future Spanish customers, right?	F
591	Yeah, exactly.	NULL
592	Okay.	NULL
593	Yeah.	NULL
594	That's, that's really important.	NULL
595	I mean, I like this, but probably you should, we should just start with the English German French set, because the most of our customers are either one of these.	F
596	Yeah, I need one of these languages.	NULL
597	So these three languages will be available at the very last launch of the software.	A
598	And then if additional Russian or Japanese or whatever, then probably we have to go with your approach or at least the direction of this approach where we need the customer to.	F
599	Yeah, while on the other hand, we cannot expect this from the customer, they pay for something	NULL
600	So for sure they don't want to provide additional work in order to be able to use it	NULL
601	Depends on how extensive it gets.	NULL
602	Yeah.	NULL
603	I mean, if there are just a few terms probably would make sense.	NULL
604	Maybe they could even add their own translations.	F
605	Yeah.	NULL
606	But I think here it I'm with Chris because if I want to use the tool in my native language, I expect that the tool is, or yeah.	NULL
607	That I expect that the tool is a way otherwise it's already ran another tool.	NULL
608	Yeah, I think we have to keep it simple here as well for this project phase one and just go with three languages, German, English, and French and French, and just make sure that at the launch day, these languages are implemented completely.	F
609	So all the elements are there in three different languages and their manager, he can switch the language somewhere on a taco to his liking.	F
610	Okay.	NULL
611	And then maybe just keep the possibility in the backlog, but that's certainly not for phase one.	F
612	Okay.	NULL
613	I mean, yeah.	NULL
614	I mean, that's also, that's quite important for you and your team.	NULL
615	Only once you start developing the actual technical parts that this has to be highly scalable in the long run.	A
616	So we will be building up in phase two and may possible phase three on the existing framework.	NULL
617	So keep that in mind too.	NULL
618	Yeah.	NULL
619	I mean like a really nice coupling also from the front and backend that allows scalability.	A
620	Yeah.	NULL
621	I mean, I think we are at the we're at a very good point.	NULL
622	I got a lot of very good feedback from you guys.	NULL
623	Maybe we should leave it at that for now because I have another meeting, which I have to attend soon.	NULL
624	So I show it, just clarify some, some more things that might be unclear for you, because from my side, I'm quite happy with our outcome of this meeting.	NULL
625	Maybe just one question, you don't have to necessarily answer it now, but maybe note it down to, to get back to me whether the reports should be exportable, for example, to, to PDF files or anything, or, or CSV.	F
626	I don't know, because for now what we were talking about is that is all online in a widget or somewhere, but maybe, maybe you, he also has to report to someone else and would require it to as a file.	F
627	Yeah, I think the report should be shareable in some form.	F
628	It may be, I mean, there will be a lot of graphical elements in such a report like charts and yeah.	F
629	I mean, other bar plots and so on.	F
630	So maybe to make sense to, to make it available.	F
631	I'm sorry, I didn't get that.	NULL

644	And if yes, in which form it should come across.	NULL
645	I think PDF is fine for now because otherwise our customers would really be interested in data science of this particular specific surveys, which I highly doubt actually.	F

714	Yeah, a lot of verification.	NULL
715	That's why I'm saying like the contracts or whatever it is. It's almost like I don't want it to be a different approach. We're still filtering it down to, if you just want a map or not, the map is there. A lot of the times, I guess when it is...	NULL
716	To me, and we talked about this a little bit before. Getting this thing Notify, the HTML5, and getting the JRM functionality in, is imperative. I think we'll be able to sell a lot more and get a lot more recurring revenue if we do that.	NULL

731	As an Owner, I want to edit my profile, so that that it is updated with new information.	F
732	You don't want to box anybody in a corner, either. That doesn't do any good for Jasmine, to say, "OK, she's the UX person now."

741	That one, I think, was a misunderstanding. Because she's trying to change it to , because in it says the equipment's available but in LCAM, it's already sourced that equipment for another shipment, so it's not available in LCAM. I really think that issue is just confusion over the fact that, that piece of equipment had already been sourced for other orders.	NULL
742	Yeah.	NULL

760	I would prefer it to be consistent if we can make it consistent. It makes it easier, whether they use it or not, as long as it does work if they do choose to use it. It isn't required if they don't choose to use it. If I try to save this now, it's going to tell me something, estimate is required or something.	NULL

762	I see both sides of that. Whatever you want to do.	NULL

769	As a Broker user, I want to have PPoPZIP+4 work the same as the Legal Entity ZIP validations.	A

790	If somebody wants to do that for me, that would help me out.	NULL
791	They've got the scanner. They can have their cycle count up and scan the stuff in. That stuff sounds more like DC3, which I did have that thought when I was talking to him about it. I don't know why I didn't invite you to this meeting. My bad.	NULL

800	As a UI designer, I want to report to the Agencies about user testing, so that they are aware of their contributions to making Broker a better UX.	F
801	That would be in line with trying to give direction to new hires about where they need to invest their time, what type of technologies that you should probably be focusing on. That would feed in with our organizational goals as well.	NULL
802	I realize we didn't do the actual disconnect.	NULL
