"id","req_specification","class"
"251","Yeah, that, that allows us particularly because yeah, it's made me more intuitive for, for P for computer users using a mouse.","A"
"91","That's no problem.","NULL"
"632","You guys hear me?","NULL"
"631","Can","NULL"
"643","I think PDF is fine for now because otherwise our customers would really be interested in data science of this particular specific surveys, which I highly doubt actually.","F"
"38","So I think we should, it's really important that we also offer such a service and we already discussed this, the board that this should probably something that can be used as a software, as a service where we have customers, they would just sign up to our application, pay a fee.","F"
"581","And then for German, you would translate it into one word.","NULL"
"583","And if the user logs in with a Spanish setting, he will get the Spanish translation for it.","F"
"183","Yeah.","NULL"
"244","I mean, without touch functionality.","NULL"
"304","So the manager wants to find out how motivated his team is at this very moment.","F"
"82","So maybe let's start with the, with the user roles.","F"
"2","I know.","NULL"
"408","But what if semantically, they don't fit?","NULL"
"559","So we say this project supports English and German and from French.","F"
"228","Well, I would pitch put, I would pitch this to the creativity department.","NULL"
"181","Like an employee or what do you think?","NULL"
"281","But maybe I have, yeah.","NULL"
"553","I actually have a different question.","NULL"
"318","I I'm, I'm not technical enough to see if this is even yeah, if this makes sense.","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","A"
"468","Yeah.","NULL"
"566","Yeah.","NULL"
"627","I mean, other bar plots and so on.","F"
"522","I have, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"647","Okay, I'll note that.","NULL"
"594","Yeah, I need one of these languages.","NULL"
"543","I think this, this should definitely be responsive.","F"
"588","Then it will be blah, blah, blah, for all future Spanish customers, right?","F"
"284","Yeah.","NULL"
"439","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"514","Maybe you can grasp this a bit better Janik, but, or maybe also you Mark as a UX specialist,","NULL"
"613","Only once you start developing the actual technical parts that this has to be highly scalable in the long run.","A"
"204","But you would not assign to specific project managers or would you?","NULL"
"471","This is also a problem with the reports in the end that's they're offering.","NULL"
"190","So I think, I think, but what Mark was trying to say is that the, the, the simplicity of simply getting an email for the employee, that should be fine because, uh, if, if the project manager or the team leader simply specifies which users to tag in this, um, in this survey and say, or she's simply addressed by their email, that is fine.","F"
"67","Yeah, I think so too.","NULL"
"481","That's also why to be called polls service something, you know?","NULL"
"198","I mean, just to keep it as simple as possible, I would just say a project manager is always top level.","A"
"561","Oh, well maybe prior what languages there are the, I have the question of where do the translations come from?","NULL"
"604","But I think here it I'm with Chris because if I want to use the tool in my native language, I expect that the tool is, or yeah.","NULL"
"486","So we can, we can group the question types together, right?","NULL"
"362","I can say this question should be commented.","F"
"122","How, how do you mean text?","NULL"
"144","Well, I think that the more we can generalize the better, right?","A"
"527","Oh, I see.","NULL"
"483","Not, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"323","So maybe, yeah.","NULL"
"357","I was not, I was not talking about every question, but for, for the follow-up survey, but for, for, for when you can like, or dislike, uh, other ideas, or maybe you want to add something to it","F"
"638","To, to report.","NULL"
"258","That makes total sense actually, but yeah.","NULL"
"269","I think we should add this because, or we should add something like in the end, uh, the questions can be pre viewed again before submitting.","NULL"
"156","How do you have any ideas on how we could actually bring the survey to the employees on a most simple way?","NULL"
"57","Yeah.","NULL"
"97","So I don't know how have you got, see, but I think it's quite important that we specify how many abstraction levels of roles we want.","A"
"433","I'm sitting at home all the time","NULL"
"131","The team leaders or the employees could, could simply select out of these predefined tags.","F"
"195","So we would need, uh, maybe this part.","NULL"
"415","Yeah, totally see this point, maybe Chris, can you elaborate or, okay.","NULL"
"648","Yeah.","NULL"
"605","That I expect that the tool is a way otherwise it's already ran another tool.","NULL"
"225","Um, we have to think about how this technically should work such a survey, right.","NULL"
"349","I mean, we could just make it so that these ideas are submitted in raw text and then, or displayed and in the report to the manager.","F"
"659","We have to reschedule many more meetings also just with you and your team Janik and Mark with, with the designers as well.","NULL"
"597","Yeah, while on the other hand, we cannot expect this from the customer, they pay for something","NULL"
"313","And others have have also this, this option to, to select or comment on.","F"
"277","Yeah.","NULL"
"14","Right.","NULL"
"129","So yeah, that would make sense.","NULL"
"192","Concrete example.","NULL"
"108","I think programming wise, it would be the same thing as interest checking for the role and that, that should not be the problem.","NULL"
"351","And he can select, wow.","NULL"
"386","I know you're the technician guy here and you can say if this is doable or not, but if we include the commands and functionality, this should be toggle.","F"
"13","Yeah.","NULL"
"534","And if we have time or resources afterwards, in another phase, we can also expand on this.","NULL"
"524","Which would mean it's maybe on two different platforms.","A"
"550","Yeah, yes.","NULL"
"436","Yeah.","NULL"
"113","Right.","NULL"
"358","Right.","NULL"
"76","I mean, this is, as you said, a, a tool for, for survey management or like creation and organization and reporting.","F"
"455","We have to group them, but we have to create a single empathy or wait sheet for each question report.","NULL"
"375","So I think maybe we should just move on a little bit.","NULL"
"17","Where, where is Tanzil?","NULL"
"600","Yeah.","NULL"
"178","So, so that the user doesn't have to anything, he will just be added by the manager to this project.","A"
"654","So maybe if something comes up, there are some unclarities we can talk in the next week for sure.","NULL"
"447","We were, yeah, exactly what the reporting.","NULL"
"384","Only question three out of five should be commended.","NULL"
"256","So on mobile devices, you can only swipe using the touch functionality.","A"
"294","Something like this will be really neat, but I'm not sure if this is way overkill.","NULL"
"229","What kind of, what kind of questions are there?","NULL"
"590","Okay.","NULL"
"371","I think we accidentally here hit another idea, which I didn't want to, to point at, but I think I would just track this down because I really liked the comment ability of questions, but it still doesn't really solve the problem, which I initially mentioned in as in to include the user.","NULL"
"124","Um, like, um, the, the content of the survey, so maybe it's about employee happiness or customer satisfaction, and we can use texts.","F"
"478","I probably forgot to pinpoint this in the project description, but this tool we're creating here, it, this should be like a easy, short thing.","NULL"
"499","From a UX perspective, this will bring a lot of benefits.","NULL"
"206","I mean, what, what are the odds that, that accompany assigned smokable project managers to such a survey tool anyways, right.","NULL"
"128","You're maybe, maybe we can say the project manager can define these texts for his company.","F"
"105","I'm not really sure here.","NULL"
"303","I'd say it's about employee motivation.","NULL"
"272","Okay, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"525","How do you mean?","NULL"
"502","I mean, if, if you, if we cook cleanly keep the different clearly keep the different elements and report apart from each other, sort of have different objects of classes.","NULL"
"388","That, I mean, the, the, the functionality itself can, is easily reusable.","NULL"
"271","Exactly.","NULL"
"448","Well, I think maybe we should, we should limit the service to specific topics, right?","A"
"603","Yeah.","NULL"
"127","You can select of a certain group.","F"
"15","So let me quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"202","So they are just all on the top level and its like a pool of project managers and the top level and out of this pool, those, the entire structure or hierarchy of the business.","A"
"530","I like this idea a lot.","NULL"
"107","Do you think this will be a big problem in terms of, um, um, technique, you know, programming?","NULL"
"155","Or how could we, how could we solve this with the survey feeling?","NULL"
"552","No, it's okay, I'm listening.","NULL"
"327","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"283","So, okay.","NULL"
"35","Cool.","NULL"
"504","It depends on, on how we entirely approach the thing.","NULL"
"149","Anyway, I know that this data, we can go into more detail on this later on.","NULL"
"546","That's I think that's that, that would be great.","NULL"
"649","Yeah.","NULL"
"245","Yeah.","NULL"
"637","What format to report?","NULL"
"112","Yeah.","NULL"
"416","Yeah, I can.","NULL"
"538","I think that's, that's a good, a good way.","NULL"
"191","Uh, I was, as I said, I was just worried about, uh, other other stuff, except from the simple may listing.","NULL"
"282","I think I already mentioned something about the engagement in the project description, which I've sent you, but I think we shouldn't go too much in depth with engagement at this point, because it's way out of scope for this first phase.","NULL"
"249","Yeah.","NULL"
"426","Yes, since I got tested positive.","NULL"
"422","It's a little early, but I manage.","NULL"
"11","Cool.","NULL"
"489","So just like to, to Mark different parts of the survey, similar to the tasks, similar to the texts, you, you can create a group and then assign, let's say three questions to this group, but in the entire survey you'll have up to eight questions.","F"
