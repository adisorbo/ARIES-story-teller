"26","Um, so yeah.","NULL"
"463","I think it's impossible to sort of group the questions by, by meaning of the question for this week.","NULL"
"447","We were, yeah, exactly what the reporting.","NULL"
"404","I think maybe for the swipe questions, we can have some, some, uh, a bar graph that shows the sides they swiped to.","F"
"468","Yeah.","NULL"
"342","You can use the Reddit approach again, where you can have comments you can upvote or downvote and then you can.","F"
"451","Let's say, I don't know, we have to think about this really detailed afterwards.","NULL"
"322","That's for sure a big problem.","NULL"
"619","I mean, I think we are at the we're at a very good point.","NULL"
"50","It's just, yeah, it's just a word we came up with actually, because as we see it, a costumer has something like an admin, but I probably wouldn't call it admin, but more like maybe project manager, you know.","F"
"18","Isn't he joining the meeting today?","NULL"
"572","One is the interactive part, which should be translated for, for the users between them.","F"
"13","Yeah.","NULL"
"62","Yeah.","NULL"
"277","Yeah.","NULL"
"245","Yeah.","NULL"
"264","Yeah.","NULL"
"52","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"528","So you use it just to make the reporting responsive so you can always view what's happening.","F"
"651","Yeah, I think I'm good.","NULL"
"361","The comment box in your, this is question specific, right.","NULL"
"291","Um, yeah, I'm not sure we somehow have to include that the ideas of, of the survey fillers and then these ideas can sort of be displayed to all the other people that are part of the survey.","A"
"401","Maybe you guys have some ideas, otherwise I'll give you mine.","NULL"
"300","Let's say more like a general feedback box.","NULL"
"601","I mean, if there are just a few terms probably would make sense.","NULL"
"617","I mean like a really nice coupling also from the front and backend that allows scalability.","A"
"392","But, but nice to know that it should have this flag.","F"
"236","Um, yeah, I noted some types of questions here in preparation for this awesome meeting.","NULL"
"120","And, um, he can filter them.","NULL"
"590","Okay.","NULL"
"87","Sounds like a bird.","NULL"
"191","Uh, I was, as I said, I was just worried about, uh, other other stuff, except from the simple may listing.","NULL"
"242","And then, uh, one can take the, the question that is depicted like a card and can just swipe it to the area wherever you want.","F"
"542","Yeah.","NULL"
"37","But now we want to have a means that our customers can easily and without much effort create service from wherever they are using their mobile device or also their notebook, whatever, you know, it's just currently in all the survey basis, it's like a trend to ease up the process of creating new service.","F"
"365","Well, I can do that.","NULL"
"213","Yeah.","NULL"
"198","I mean, just to keep it as simple as possible, I would just say a project manager is always top level.","A"
"461","And then of course, it's, it's the manager who created the survey.","NULL"
"294","Something like this will be really neat, but I'm not sure if this is way overkill.","NULL"
"231","Yeah, we need something fancy looking and also something innovative.","A"
"394","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"656","Trust me.","NULL"
"444","I, yeah, I really had to take this phone call.","NULL"
"544","So we have two elements with which for sure need to be responsive, which is the reporting and survey mask.","F"
"158","If I can talk here, maybe we could just send them an invite by email, like on the company email or an internal email?","F"
"257","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"566","Yeah.","NULL"
"584","But this, the Spanish translation has to be valid for all future Spanish companies that join our software as well, right?","NULL"
"490","Yeah, it makes sense.","NULL"
"8","Wait, wait.","NULL"
"470","And also from a user experience part, and I think the limiting of the questions would not be a good, a good thing because what if you have, for example, 12 questions, so you have to create two different surveys.","NULL"
"586","So once the Spanish has been done.","NULL"
"663","Cool, guys, thank you so much for your time.","NULL"
"318","I I'm, I'm not technical enough to see if this is even yeah, if this makes sense.","NULL"
"661","So I'll just stack get all this information in a readable document and I'll provide you with it.","NULL"
"140","But I get your point on that.","NULL"
"119","So, uh, I think he should be able to see all the, uh, the surveys from the normal metrics by business unit.","F"
"145","Because we need, I mean, you know, you work now in our business for quite a while, both of you, so, you know, the set of customers you already have.","NULL"
"262","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"443","Sorry, I'm back.","NULL"
"370","Me, I, as a manager can get feedback in whether people liked and understood the question or not.","F"
"336","And then he can include this in the followup survey, like Mark mentioned, and in this follow-up survey, the people then get to vote.","F"
"282","I think I already mentioned something about the engagement in the project description, which I've sent you, but I think we shouldn't go too much in depth with engagement at this point, because it's way out of scope for this first phase.","NULL"
"369","I mean, I really liked the idea of making questions commendable like that.","NULL"
"113","Right.","NULL"
"200","Nonetheless, Is there just a single one or are there multiple?","NULL"
"176","I mean, actually I really like what Mark said.","NULL"
"92","No, no, that's okay.","NULL"
"228","Well, I would pitch put, I would pitch this to the creativity department.","NULL"
"487","That's actually the exact input I was hoping for, because I mean, technically you, if, if within the same survey you have different topics for some reason, technically you could assign ma as in a group to, to the questions so that it would be possible to, to then in the report group by, by these question groups for, for the results.","NULL"
"533","I think for the beginning, this would surely be enough.","NULL"
"284","Yeah.","NULL"
"238","Like everybody knows them, uh, of course single and multiple choice questions, and maybe we can also add something like swipe questions so that you can have maybe a left-hand side, the right-hand side and a button bottom side.","F"
"390","And then this is a simple flag displayed or not displayed.","F"
"148","But I mean, I already liked the idea of text.","NULL"
"190","So I think, I think, but what Mark was trying to say is that the, the, the simplicity of simply getting an email for the employee, that should be fine because, uh, if, if the project manager or the team leader simply specifies which users to tag in this, um, in this survey and say, or she's simply addressed by their email, that is fine.","F"
"508","Yeah, right.","NULL"
"387","Yeah.","NULL"
"473","Exactly.","NULL"
"25","I haven't seen this email.","NULL"
"306","Maybe he asks them what motivates you most at work.","NULL"
"339","But then, then I would maybe I know how, how from the, from the UX perspective, this goes, but like simple swipe would not be sufficient for this.","NULL"
"330","Do we have to leave this to the manager?","NULL"
"623","Maybe just one question, you don't have to necessarily answer it now, but maybe note it down to, to get back to me whether the reports should be exportable, for example, to, to PDF files or anything, or, or CSV.","F"
"24","Sorry.","NULL"
"378","So people can, if the manager allows command specific questions, which I really liked this skip some sort of inclusion,","F"
"43","So I think there will be something like managers and maybe something like, um, uh, super admin.","F"
"214","Okay.","NULL"
"320","I just see one problem, because if I'm the first one to complete the survey, I won't get to see the questions or the bring ups from the other people that take the survey afterwards.","A"
"225","Um, we have to think about how this technically should work such a survey, right.","NULL"
"607","So all the elements are there in three different languages and their manager, he can switch the language somewhere on a taco to his liking.","F"
"249","Yeah.","NULL"
"122","How, how do you mean text?","NULL"
"59","So, I mean, of course there are like you have to properly already, um, think of how, how we possibly can reflect such a hierarchical, um, role system in a technical way.","F"
"499","From a UX perspective, this will bring a lot of benefits.","NULL"
"409","I mean, what if let's, let's say you have, um, out of 10 questions in your survey, you have three questions regarding, uh, let's say communication within the team and these three questions they are related.","NULL"
"232","I mean, the types of questions I just mentioned there, everyone knows them, but maybe we could come up with something innovative, which will be a unique selling point for our application.","NULL"
"270","So like the answers, Hey, that's what you answered to use submit this.","NULL"
"476","I really, yeah, I'm really sorry.","NULL"
"184","I think that's what you just said.","NULL"
"222","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"143","Right.","NULL"
"162","But just so that I understand you right, so that as a user, I don't really have to, um, log in or anything?","F"
"150","I think that's already quite a good input.","NULL"
"327","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"261","Just to finish my thing, sorry.","NULL"
"31","Yeah.","NULL"
"71","Or do you have any questions just before we go into detail now, do you guys have any questions overall?","NULL"
"208","You don't need a lot of, I mean, we, we talk, um, top level managers of a business here probably to be overkill if, if a business would have more than one managing this, this, this little, um, aspect of the business, right.","NULL"
"505","I mean, you're right, because the indie individual widgets or, or whatever this is, then they are modular and we can move them without problem.","NULL"
"344","The question type is it's like an open question texting, but it only serves the purpose for four survey fiddlers to commit their ideas.","NULL"
"173","Yeah.","NULL"
"178","So, so that the user doesn't have to anything, he will just be added by the manager to this project.","A"
"188","Yeah.","NULL"
"279","Bring your others as well.","NULL"
"547","If we could nail this for phase one, actually, yeah.","A"
"216","I mean, are there specifics we, we need to discuss or that they're unclear or.","NULL"
"74","Yeah.","NULL"
"243","How, how would you solve this if someone uses a traditional computer or notebook?","A"
"303","I'd say it's about employee motivation.","NULL"
"578","No, technically we don't have to, we can hard-code translation, codes, and then simply register translations for these codes.","A"
"435","No, nothing.","NULL"
"526","So like the, the actual configuration would probably happen on a, on a desktop or laptop, but for, for the single reporting, if you are in a meeting, you have your iPad with you.","NULL"
"299","No, not really survey questions and more well let's, let's give me, let's give you a concrete example.","NULL"
"512","Okay, I see.","NULL"
"614","So we will be building up in phase two and may possible phase three on the existing framework.","NULL"
"411","One is an, I don't know, open text question.","NULL"
"331","What Erin, we, in the report, there is a, maybe a dedicated section for a user feedback or user inputs were very conceived for, for which questions, which additional inputs came in.","A"
"595","So these three languages will be available at the very last launch of the software.","A"
"386","I know you're the technician guy here and you can say if this is doable or not, but if we include the commands and functionality, this should be toggle.","F"
"240","And maybe the left side is no, the right is yes.","F"
"129","So yeah, that would make sense.","NULL"
"621","Maybe we should leave it at that for now because I have another meeting, which I have to attend soon.","NULL"
