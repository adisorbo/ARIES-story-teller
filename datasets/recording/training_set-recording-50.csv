"id","req_specification","class"
"497","So the manager can move around the elements as he wants so he can sort of create this own sorting.","F"
"573","And what I meant is like the entire GUI, so the, all, all the fixed static texts from menus and that stuff,","F"
"204","But you would not assign to specific project managers or would you?","NULL"
"498","Yeah.","NULL"
"1","Let's do it.","NULL"
"446","So where were we?","NULL"
"600","Yeah.","NULL"
"130","Yeah.","NULL"
"404","I think maybe for the swipe questions, we can have some, some, uh, a bar graph that shows the sides they swiped to.","F"
"15","So let me quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"527","Oh, I see.","NULL"
"201","We could talk about, I think there should be the possibility to have multiple.","A"
"116","I think it's really important that we come up with a neat design where let's say a project manager, he can feel there and he can also customize his, um, dashboard.","F"
"419","There's someone calling me,","NULL"
"364","Yeah.","NULL"
"435","No, nothing.","NULL"
"337","It's like the manager then will be like a first filter that filters out.","F"
"128","You're maybe, maybe we can say the project manager can define these texts for his company.","F"
"484","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"332","And then that then remains the question with, with the voting.","A"
"521","Maybe not the iPhone, but at least the tablets.","F"
"326","But then you get two emails.","NULL"
"606","Yeah, I think we have to keep it simple here as well for this project phase one and just go with three languages, German, English, and French and French, and just make sure that at the launch day, these languages are implemented completely.","F"
"568","I mean, I was just also the other day I was searching the net and I found DeepL this translation API, and maybe it would also be possible to include some sort of deeper API as in if a manager or now if a user creates an English question, people will automatically translate it to German storing the germ part of this question.","F"
"211","Certainly depends on, on which exact client we're talking about.","NULL"
"627","I mean, other bar plots and so on.","F"
"221","So, uh, let me just quickly write this down here.","NULL"
"80","So yeah, that, that's fine.","NULL"
"70","I don't have to explain what it, what it will do in the end, right?","NULL"
"8","Wait, wait.","NULL"
"256","So on mobile devices, you can only swipe using the touch functionality.","A"
"371","I think we accidentally here hit another idea, which I didn't want to, to point at, but I think I would just track this down because I really liked the comment ability of questions, but it still doesn't really solve the problem, which I initially mentioned in as in to include the user.","NULL"
"89","Uh, this, my mother [inaudible], um, she's finished in two minutes.","NULL"
"585","Not, not every user has to specify own Spanish translation to be global.","A"
"536","I mean, we can choose an approach, which would make the global possibility for responsive design, but maybe just not in detail implemented on each side.","A"
"480","But here it's just together a claims like the manager really wants to fill the polls of his team in a specific topic.","NULL"
"220","This is solely the, um, the task of a manager.","A"
"27","Um, yeah, right.","NULL"
"137","Yeah.","NULL"
"356","The reason I am saying this is, I'm not sure if, if we make every question, comment, the bolus you guys suggest to","NULL"
"580","Let's say you have the translation code, which should the books scale.","NULL"
"411","One is an, I don't know, open text question.","NULL"
"593","I mean, I like this, but probably you should, we should just start with the English German French set, because the most of our customers are either one of these.","F"
"595","So these three languages will be available at the very last launch of the software.","A"
"180","And from there on, he will receive mails, but all this language setting stuff, maybe shouldn't concern that the user, I mean, with user, I mean the survey filler, right?","NULL"
"570","I think so, yeah.","NULL"
"360","And that was the idea for, for the common box, but not for every question.","NULL"
"223","So, um, then we also have to think about the surgery itself.","NULL"
"417","I'm thinking actually, but I, yeah, I haven't really thought about this specific scenario, which is quite an important one.","NULL"
"210","Yeah.","NULL"
"646","Yeah, makes sense.","NULL"
"368","Yeah.","NULL"
"45","I mean, we need some, some, uh, sort of, um, possibility to manage this entire tool.","F"
"165","Ah, okay.","NULL"
"591","Yeah.","NULL"
"529","For example,","NULL"
"587","So for example, scale question is blah, blah, blah.","NULL"
"362","I can say this question should be commented.","F"
"276","Yeah, I like that.","NULL"
"265","Just a quick input.","NULL"
"345","So just keep in mind, open text is evil.","NULL"
"144","Well, I think that the more we can generalize the better, right?","A"
"647","Okay, I'll note that.","NULL"
"474","This is the point, which I think Mark, you haven't really understood.","NULL"
"509","I mean, that's, that's good that you mentioned the point of, of, of how it actually should look in there because here, we also have to keep in mind that the design of this tool has to be responsive, right.","A"
"129","So yeah, that would make sense.","NULL"
"393","Yeah right, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"43","So I think there will be something like managers and maybe something like, um, uh, super admin.","F"
"200","Nonetheless, Is there just a single one or are there multiple?","NULL"
"187","Because then we don't have to manage like, see, a thousands and billions of user accounts.","NULL"
"216","I mean, are there specifics we, we need to discuss or that they're unclear or.","NULL"
"512","Okay, I see.","NULL"
"297","Um, I think just for the technical side, it should, of course be possible, but I'm not sure about budget or time scope.","NULL"
"133","Yeah.","NULL"
"390","And then this is a simple flag displayed or not displayed.","F"
"343","Or making maybe, maybe we should just create a new question type.","NULL"
"249","Yeah.","NULL"
"661","So I'll just stack get all this information in a readable document and I'll provide you with it.","NULL"
"48","I mean, is there a regular admin?","NULL"
"420","How's your life going?","NULL"
"328","Well maybe, maybe we could include them in the, you know, at the end of the survey, a report is created out of this survey, which lists the results of the different questions, right?","F"
"277","Yeah.","NULL"
"399","Because the manager, they want to be clean, clean, and easy to understand view what's happening within their survey or what are the results.","F"
"408","But what if semantically, they don't fit?","NULL"
"245","Yeah.","NULL"
"644","I think they just want to have nice widgets, which they can include in their internal meetings or yeah.","F"
"325","Maybe we can collect these questions and make us a follow-up survey, which then, or something like that in the end.","F"
"584","But this, the Spanish translation has to be valid for all future Spanish companies that join our software as well, right?","NULL"
"380","If the manager allows, so this is also configurable?","NULL"
"378","So people can, if the manager allows command specific questions, which I really liked this skip some sort of inclusion,","F"
"93","Maybe it's just simply, can you mute your mic if you're saying something?","NULL"
"315","So yes, exactly.","NULL"
"164","Uh, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"447","We were, yeah, exactly what the reporting.","NULL"
"266","I mean, I don't know how, you know, the functionality, but sometimes if you just try swiping through and then you realize, Oh, that was the wrong side.","NULL"
"629","I'm sorry, I didn't get that.","NULL"
"532","Let me know what this,","NULL"
"26","Um, so yeah.","NULL"
"662","Okay, all right.","NULL"
"96","Like maybe a team miniature or some sort of friend business unit manager.","F"
"202","So they are just all on the top level and its like a pool of project managers and the top level and out of this pool, those, the entire structure or hierarchy of the business.","A"
"52","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"548","I just put this here in the projects goals, you guys see it in the documents I'll share afterwards, but that's that's yeah, that that's, that would be a really important.","NULL"
"112","Yeah.","NULL"
"583","And if the user logs in with a Spanish setting, he will get the Spanish translation for it.","F"
"338","The really unnecessary I listen is in his opinion, from the really nice things which he sees worth sharing.","NULL"
"177","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"49","No, actually there, there isn't, I mean, super admin.","NULL"
"217","Yeah, I mean that, there are a lot of unclear, um, topics still.","NULL"
"649","Yeah.","NULL"
"330","Do we have to leave this to the manager?","NULL"
"431","So, so now you're, you're sitting at home enjoying your life or?","NULL"
"433","I'm sitting at home all the time","NULL"
"176","I mean, actually I really like what Mark said.","NULL"
"460","Then we have the same for open text question, multiple single choice and so on.","NULL"
"146","I mean, we ha we, we don't, we have a lot of customers, but it's still quite, um, well, it's, we, we don't serve the whole world.","NULL"
"238","Like everybody knows them, uh, of course single and multiple choice questions, and maybe we can also add something like swipe questions so that you can have maybe a left-hand side, the right-hand side and a button bottom side.","F"
"466","But normally the questionnaire is already grouped by, by topic, isn't it?","NULL"
"349","I mean, we could just make it so that these ideas are submitted in raw text and then, or displayed and in the report to the manager.","F"
"182","I think Mark, you, you, you have the right track on this.","NULL"
"198","I mean, just to keep it as simple as possible, I would just say a project manager is always top level.","A"
"441","Okay.","NULL"
"469","Yeah, of course.","NULL"
"324","I don't know.","NULL"
"596","And then if additional Russian or Japanese or whatever, then probably we have to go with your approach or at least the direction of this approach where we need the customer to.","F"
"538","I think that's, that's a good, a good way.","NULL"
"439","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"75","Um, from my side, I think it is mostly clear.","NULL"
"123","I don't really understand this.","NULL"
"122","How, how do you mean text?","NULL"
"67","Yeah, I think so too.","NULL"
"557","So yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"556","I think it would make sense to have a default language for approach check.","F"
"235","Perfect.","NULL"
"78","And if there are questions we'll go with.","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","A"
"11","Cool.","NULL"
"222","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"579","I don't know what you mean by that.","NULL"
"299","No, not really survey questions and more well let's, let's give me, let's give you a concrete example.","NULL"
"388","That, I mean, the, the, the functionality itself can, is easily reusable.","NULL"
"375","So I think maybe we should just move on a little bit.","NULL"
"545","Yeah.","NULL"
"212","But I think I get you a general concept.","NULL"
"23","Oh yeah, right.","NULL"
"490","Yeah, it makes sense.","NULL"
"534","And if we have time or resources afterwards, in another phase, we can also expand on this.","NULL"
"272","Okay, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"494","That's, that's something I just noted it down, but something we have to keep in mind and go more into that.","NULL"
"38","So I think we should, it's really important that we also offer such a service and we already discussed this, the board that this should probably something that can be used as a software, as a service where we have customers, they would just sign up to our application, pay a fee.","F"
"566","Yeah.","NULL"
"522","I have, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"121","Maybe we can also add some texts to the, to the, to the surveys for easy filtering or something like that.","F"
"295","So technically, I mean, we, we have a timeframe of around six months for this phase one, so I'm not sure if this is all working, maybe only you can.","NULL"
"125","Would that be a fully customizable tag or predefined texts?","F"
"334","That, yeah, it's just up to the manager, up to the manager to see what came in in this specific survey, right?","NULL"
"434","But what about symptoms?","NULL"
"314","Okay.","NULL"
"437","Maybe a little cough.","NULL"
"586","So once the Spanish has been done.","NULL"
"438","My friends it's the only rough, but otherwise probably same as me.","NULL"
"102","I mean, only the managers are allowed to actually run a survey.","F"
"416","Yeah, I can.","NULL"
"107","Do you think this will be a big problem in terms of, um, um, technique, you know, programming?","NULL"
"81","Okay.","NULL"
"443","Sorry, I'm back.","NULL"
"321","True, true.","NULL"
"425","What about you?","NULL"
"252","But, but we would have to, to, to maybe restrict that on the mobile devices.","A"
"21","Uh, this information didn't reach me, but, uh, that's fine with me.","NULL"
"118","Yeah, I think this would be a good approach.","NULL"
"292","And these people can then decide if these are good ideas or not.","NULL"
"537","Yeah.","NULL"
"31","Yeah.","NULL"
"514","Maybe you can grasp this a bit better Janik, but, or maybe also you Mark as a UX specialist,","NULL"
"559","So we say this project supports English and German and from French.","F"
"395","I was probably just thinking this for myself, but yeah, that's good that it, that you, yeah.","NULL"
"632","You guys hear me?","NULL"
"651","Yeah, I think I'm good.","NULL"
"88","Yeah.","NULL"
"622","So I show it, just clarify some, some more things that might be unclear for you, because from my side, I'm quite happy with our outcome of this meeting.","NULL"
"14","Right.","NULL"
"634","Okay.","NULL"
"274","Hm.","NULL"
"193","Yeah.","NULL"
"511","Then again, customization brings a certain instability to the responsive design, because we can probably not predict how it's going to look.","NULL"
"373","Um, yeah, but maybe, maybe I have to think about this more anyways.","NULL"
"7","So let me just quickly.","NULL"
"289","So you mean like in the end of the survey, you can have, uh, some of that somewhat the first question creator and, uh, the, the guys of the survey of the guys that they decided to be off, the roads can agree to this or, or something like that.","F"
"625","Yeah, I think the report should be shareable in some form.","F"
"614","So we will be building up in phase two and may possible phase three on the existing framework.","NULL"
"406","What do you think about this?","NULL"
"94","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"523","Maybe because you, you need also a good input device, like a keyboard or something, because if you create new employees or new questions, you need to type a bit of text,","F"
"353","This idea of user one is nice.","NULL"
"219","So I would really like it, if an employee doesn't have to do any, it doesn't have to do anything to, to be part of a project.","A"
"594","Yeah, I need one of these languages.","NULL"
"602","Maybe they could even add their own translations.","F"
"628","So maybe to make sense to, to make it available.","F"
"66","Okay.","NULL"
"246","You can just use the mouse cursor and drag the cart to the, to the area.","A"
"175","So we also have to consider language settings for users. I'm not really sure how we could address this problem.","A"
"53","If you have a business hierarchy of a bit of, of a specific company, then let's say the top manager board, they will typically, some of them are maybe only one of the top managers will be the project manager of a project because he will sort of manage all the subordinates business units.","F"
"401","Maybe you guys have some ideas, otherwise I'll give you mine.","NULL"
"226","What kind of question makes sense in it?","NULL"
"9","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"229","What kind of, what kind of questions are there?","NULL"
"282","I think I already mentioned something about the engagement in the project description, which I've sent you, but I think we shouldn't go too much in depth with engagement at this point, because it's way out of scope for this first phase.","NULL"
"348","No, but I think we sh we wouldn't have to go that far.","NULL"
"589","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"36","So yeah, I mean that overall wish actually is to extend our, um, services, you know, as for now our costumer mainly, um, fill out service your post or over the, um, portal, which we've set up last year.","NULL"
"251","Yeah, that, that allows us particularly because yeah, it's made me more intuitive for, for P for computer users using a mouse.","A"
"186","So from a technical point of view, Janik, it will be probably easiest that way, right?","NULL"
"18","Isn't he joining the meeting today?","NULL"
"618","Yeah.","NULL"
"173","Yeah.","NULL"
"643","I think PDF is fine for now because otherwise our customers would really be interested in data science of this particular specific surveys, which I highly doubt actually.","F"
"456","So scale question, one of the reports will get its own, which is fair.","NULL"
"181","Like an employee or what do you think?","NULL"
"151","Okay.","NULL"
"237","So first, uh, I would, I thought about open text questions.","F"
"352","Okay.","NULL"
"355","That's all, there shouldn't be any, um, post-processing of these ideas.","NULL"
"62","Yeah.","NULL"
"255","Okay.","NULL"
"351","And he can select, wow.","NULL"
"599","Depends on how extensive it gets.","NULL"
"269","I think we should add this because, or we should add something like in the end, uh, the questions can be pre viewed again before submitting.","NULL"
"464","We will have to include really complicated the algorithms, maybe even NLP or something, which should be way out of scope.","NULL"
"454","Yeah.","NULL"
"283","So, okay.","NULL"
"358","Right.","NULL"
"331","What Erin, we, in the report, there is a, maybe a dedicated section for a user feedback or user inputs were very conceived for, for which questions, which additional inputs came in.","A"
"310","I don't know, the espresso machine motivates me the most at work so I can submit this and then others should see this.","NULL"
"147","So I think maybe, yeah, maybe it will make sense to sort of come up with the generalized, um, set of texts.","A"
"225","Um, we have to think about how this technically should work such a survey, right.","NULL"
"571","But now, well, I would give the admin the possibility to correct the translation at least, but just, just as we clear, we are now talking about two different things.","F"
"342","You can use the Reddit approach again, where you can have comments you can upvote or downvote and then you can.","F"
"214","Okay.","NULL"
"305","So the questions evolve around motivation.","A"
"610","Okay.","NULL"
"113","Right.","NULL"
"336","And then he can include this in the followup survey, like Mark mentioned, and in this follow-up survey, the people then get to vote.","F"
"468","Yeah.","NULL"
"103","So, um, for a project manager, he should be able to run surveys to all of the business, including all of the employees and stop or didn't managers such as maybe possible team and actress should only be able to create service including their own team and maybe some organic teams, you know how I mean?","F"
"127","You can select of a certain group.","F"
"191","Uh, I was, as I said, I was just worried about, uh, other other stuff, except from the simple may listing.","NULL"
"339","But then, then I would maybe I know how, how from the, from the UX perspective, this goes, but like simple swipe would not be sufficient for this.","NULL"
"199","So every other user and team leader belongs to a project manager.","A"
"243","How, how would you solve this if someone uses a traditional computer or notebook?","A"
"635","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"428","It's really tough when","NULL"
"320","I just see one problem, because if I'm the first one to complete the survey, I won't get to see the questions or the bring ups from the other people that take the survey afterwards.","A"
"369","I mean, I really liked the idea of making questions commendable like that.","NULL"
"311","And then maybe the teams like, Oh yeah, we all need the espresso machine.","NULL"
"517","On an iPad, I think, yes.","F"
"341","Is there a, an approach for this?","NULL"
"259","Would be nice.","NULL"
"663","Cool, guys, thank you so much for your time.","NULL"
"24","Sorry.","NULL"
"612","I mean, that's also, that's quite important for you and your team.","NULL"
"440","I thought it was, it was kind of, kind of a joke, but if it weren't for Corona, I would have gone to work without any problems, honestly.","NULL"
"640","So like technically, both would be both will be possible because of the PDF would just be the graphical representation of it.","A"
"457","Sorry, scale question.","NULL"
"407","Just like maybe all the open text questions are grouped together in the report and all other types of questions are also grouped together,","A"
"242","And then, uh, one can take the, the question that is depicted like a card and can just swipe it to the area wherever you want.","F"
"40","So they just sign up in order to use the services and, um, the service as itself.","F"
"101","Yeah.","NULL"
"44","So this will be asked.","NULL"
"513","I'm not sure.","NULL"
"58","Um, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"169","Do we, do we actually have to assign specific users as in, uh, on the platform?","NULL"
"189","Well, with the user accounts that is actually I think more ideal because then we can actually like pinpoint to specific users and it's not an email floating around somewhere.","NULL"
"659","We have to reschedule many more meetings also just with you and your team Janik and Mark with, with the designers as well.","NULL"
"432","Uh, I wouldn't say yeah.","NULL"
"194","Maybe, maybe the, the language settings, as you said, or maybe he belongs to different business units.","NULL"
"268","Yeah.","NULL"
"47","Um, by the way, why super admin?","NULL"
"22","Well, it was decided yesterday.","NULL"
"626","It may be, I mean, there will be a lot of graphical elements in such a report like charts and yeah.","F"
"510","Because it has to be viewable on different devices.","F"
"461","And then of course, it's, it's the manager who created the survey.","NULL"
"142","Yeah.","NULL"
"109","Um, I'm, I'm thinking more of a, of a usage issue.","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","F"
"6","Yeah.","NULL"
"134","Okay.","NULL"
"250","Okay.","NULL"
"381","Yeah, it definitely has to be configurable because otherwise let's say I, as a manager, create the survey, complaining five questions.","F"
"117","So as to only see, what's really important for him to see at this very moment, but if you want to, can see all.","NULL"
"29","Just, uh, the one that briefly describes our mission about this project.","NULL"
"533","I think for the beginning, this would surely be enough.","NULL"
"409","I mean, what if let's, let's say you have, um, out of 10 questions in your survey, you have three questions regarding, uh, let's say communication within the team and these three questions they are related.","NULL"
"664","Thank you and have a nice day.","NULL"
"549","Yeah, so that's","NULL"
"485","Like this, it would totally make sense to limit them to 10 and like this, I think there's also only one topic per, per survey.","NULL"
"158","If I can talk here, maybe we could just send them an invite by email, like on the company email or an internal email?","F"
"98","Depends on what they should be able to do.","NULL"
"639","Yeah.","NULL"
"35","Cool.","NULL"
"287","They should not just be there in click to questions they should of bringing in their own ideas, which in turns can then be seen by other users.","F"
"111","What if he has every survey available?","F"
"284","Yeah.","NULL"
"598","So for sure they don't want to provide additional work in order to be able to use it","NULL"
"20","I think we agreed that we were going to do this on our own, the three of us.","NULL"
"316","But I don't really see how this should be working, right.","NULL"
"488","I don't know how much sense this makes, but I think it, it should be possible from a technical aspect.","NULL"
"120","And, um, he can filter them.","NULL"
"623","Maybe just one question, you don't have to necessarily answer it now, but maybe note it down to, to get back to me whether the reports should be exportable, for example, to, to PDF files or anything, or, or CSV.","F"
"17","Where, where is Tanzil?","NULL"
"415","Yeah, totally see this point, maybe Chris, can you elaborate or, okay.","NULL"
"656","Trust me.","NULL"
"25","I haven't seen this email.","NULL"
"179","And as soon as this happened, he sort of maybe gets a email that says Hey, welcome to the, to this, uh, project.","A"
