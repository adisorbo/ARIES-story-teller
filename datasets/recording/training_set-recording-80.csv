"id","req_specification","class"
"56","Okay.","NULL"
"248","Could we just also like make, make the, the side thingy a button like that you could just, instead of swiping also just click there.","NULL"
"462","It's, it's his job to make sense out of this data.","NULL"
"30","The word document you mean?","NULL"
"138","This could be quite interesting.","NULL"
"497","So the manager can move around the elements as he wants so he can sort of create this own sorting.","F"
"265","Just a quick input.","NULL"
"389","If you once built the comment box, you can simply copy paste it from, from your perspective, right?","NULL"
"1","Let's do it.","NULL"
"285","I should've mentioned this earlier, sorry, but maybe, maybe less about the, the actual functionality and more about the design will be really nice.","NULL"
"445","This was important.","NULL"
"394","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"6","Yeah.","NULL"
"474","This is the point, which I think Mark, you haven't really understood.","NULL"
"219","So I would really like it, if an employee doesn't have to do any, it doesn't have to do anything to, to be part of a project.","A"
"8","Wait, wait.","NULL"
"512","Okay, I see.","NULL"
"628","So maybe to make sense to, to make it available.","F"
"261","Just to finish my thing, sorry.","NULL"
"54","Yeah.","NULL"
"634","Okay.","NULL"
"253","Yeah, no, no, no, not the swipe, but the click, you mean that you accidentally clicked somewhere.","NULL"
"399","Because the manager, they want to be clean, clean, and easy to understand view what's happening within their survey or what are the results.","F"
"309","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"243","How, how would you solve this if someone uses a traditional computer or notebook?","A"
"24","Sorry.","NULL"
"305","So the questions evolve around motivation.","A"
"446","So where were we?","NULL"
"70","I don't have to explain what it, what it will do in the end, right?","NULL"
"573","And what I meant is like the entire GUI, so the, all, all the fixed static texts from menus and that stuff,","F"
"85","Maybe we can talk about the naming later on.","NULL"
"529","For example,","NULL"
"418","Maybe, uh, I mean, I think it's important that we have some sort of, which it for each individual question the report and then, um, hold on.","F"
"22","Well, it was decided yesterday.","NULL"
"336","And then he can include this in the followup survey, like Mark mentioned, and in this follow-up survey, the people then get to vote.","F"
"393","Yeah right, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"50","It's just, yeah, it's just a word we came up with actually, because as we see it, a costumer has something like an admin, but I probably wouldn't call it admin, but more like maybe project manager, you know.","F"
"125","Would that be a fully customizable tag or predefined texts?","F"
"607","So all the elements are there in three different languages and their manager, he can switch the language somewhere on a taco to his liking.","F"
"12","But I can, yeah.","NULL"
"31","Yeah.","NULL"
"205","Nah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do this at the initial, at this point of phase one of our project, because I think we should keep it simple.","Null"
"342","You can use the Reddit approach again, where you can have comments you can upvote or downvote and then you can.","F"
"89","Uh, this, my mother [inaudible], um, she's finished in two minutes.","NULL"
"103","So, um, for a project manager, he should be able to run surveys to all of the business, including all of the employees and stop or didn't managers such as maybe possible team and actress should only be able to create service including their own team and maybe some organic teams, you know how I mean?","F"
"596","And then if additional Russian or Japanese or whatever, then probably we have to go with your approach or at least the direction of this approach where we need the customer to.","F"
"350","So the manager sees, okay, user one set, blah, blah, blah, user two set blah, blah, blah, nothing more than that.","NULL"
"567","I think that would actually make sense that we keep it like that in this tool as well.","NULL"
"601","I mean, if there are just a few terms probably would make sense.","NULL"
"544","So we have two elements with which for sure need to be responsive, which is the reporting and survey mask.","F"
"7","So let me just quickly.","NULL"
"84","Uh, let me just quickly write this down here as a side note.","NULL"
"464","We will have to include really complicated the algorithms, maybe even NLP or something, which should be way out of scope.","NULL"
"536","I mean, we can choose an approach, which would make the global possibility for responsive design, but maybe just not in detail implemented on each side.","A"
"43","So I think there will be something like managers and maybe something like, um, uh, super admin.","F"
"335","So he, at the end, in the report, he sees all the feedback of the users, but then he himself can decide which of these he liked.","A"
"518","I mean, think about, think about the manager who's often walking around or visiting different I don't know, departments, and instead of laptops, they have iPads.","NULL"
"379","Wait, wait, wait.","NULL"
"87","Sounds like a bird.","NULL"
"653","I'm good to, I'm just looking forward to all the notes you took.","NULL"
"262","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"184","I think that's what you just said.","NULL"
"240","And maybe the left side is no, the right is yes.","F"
"334","That, yeah, it's just up to the manager, up to the manager to see what came in in this specific survey, right?","NULL"
"58","Um, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"356","The reason I am saying this is, I'm not sure if, if we make every question, comment, the bolus you guys suggest to","NULL"
"165","Ah, okay.","NULL"
"508","Yeah, right.","NULL"
"456","So scale question, one of the reports will get its own, which is fair.","NULL"
"90","Should I, uh?","NULL"
"412","And one is, uh, the scale of satisfaction, something.","NULL"
"485","Like this, it would totally make sense to limit them to 10 and like this, I think there's also only one topic per, per survey.","NULL"
"602","Maybe they could even add their own translations.","F"
"611","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"587","So for example, scale question is blah, blah, blah.","NULL"
"361","The comment box in your, this is question specific, right.","NULL"
"431","So, so now you're, you're sitting at home enjoying your life or?","NULL"
"663","Cool, guys, thank you so much for your time.","NULL"
"132","Yeah.","NULL"
"301","Exactly.","NULL"
"317","Because it should have some oper download functionality attached with that.","F"
"186","So from a technical point of view, Janik, it will be probably easiest that way, right?","NULL"
"53","If you have a business hierarchy of a bit of, of a specific company, then let's say the top manager board, they will typically, some of them are maybe only one of the top managers will be the project manager of a project because he will sort of manage all the subordinates business units.","F"
"331","What Erin, we, in the report, there is a, maybe a dedicated section for a user feedback or user inputs were very conceived for, for which questions, which additional inputs came in.","A"
"166","So the manager will actually create this user and then the user is sort of in the system and will receive the emails on the email address which the managers specified.","F"
"640","So like technically, both would be both will be possible because of the PDF would just be the graphical representation of it.","A"
"199","So every other user and team leader belongs to a project manager.","A"
"477","No, it's no offense.","NULL"
"120","And, um, he can filter them.","NULL"
"222","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"383","So I want to configure it.","NULL"
"614","So we will be building up in phase two and may possible phase three on the existing framework.","NULL"
"310","I don't know, the espresso machine motivates me the most at work so I can submit this and then others should see this.","NULL"
"470","And also from a user experience part, and I think the limiting of the questions would not be a good, a good thing because what if you have, for example, 12 questions, so you have to create two different surveys.","NULL"
"563","Are there, can you translate them?","NULL"
"321","True, true.","NULL"
"652","Mark, do you have something?","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","F"
"575","Yeah.","NULL"
"102","I mean, only the managers are allowed to actually run a survey.","F"
"430","Okay, I didn't know that.","NULL"
"121","Maybe we can also add some texts to the, to the, to the surveys for easy filtering or something like that.","F"
"505","I mean, you're right, because the indie individual widgets or, or whatever this is, then they are modular and we can move them without problem.","NULL"
"167","Yeah.","NULL"
"592","That's, that's really important.","NULL"
"440","I thought it was, it was kind of, kind of a joke, but if it weren't for Corona, I would have gone to work without any problems, honestly.","NULL"
"636","So what's this, what's this your question?","NULL"
"80","So yeah, that, that's fine.","NULL"
"268","Yeah.","NULL"
"537","Yeah.","NULL"
"569","I'm not sure if this is technically doable, actually,","A"
"535","Yes.","NULL"
"169","Do we, do we actually have to assign specific users as in, uh, on the platform?","NULL"
"451","Let's say, I don't know, we have to think about this really detailed afterwards.","NULL"
"215","So apart from, from the, from the mailing list, um, which Mark, uh, mentioned, what else is there?","NULL"
"223","So, um, then we also have to think about the surgery itself.","NULL"
"239","And there's the question.","NULL"
"213","Yeah.","NULL"
"116","I think it's really important that we come up with a neat design where let's say a project manager, he can feel there and he can also customize his, um, dashboard.","F"
"27","Um, yeah, right.","NULL"
"557","So yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"162","But just so that I understand you right, so that as a user, I don't really have to, um, log in or anything?","F"
"299","No, not really survey questions and more well let's, let's give me, let's give you a concrete example.","NULL"
"413","And now if you propose that they are not, they are not, uh, connected, but they are grouped into their types.","NULL"
"159","So they have an account, but they never, uh, they never, they don't have access with this account to the, to our tool.","F"
"423","Stressful day.","NULL"
"461","And then of course, it's, it's the manager who created the survey.","NULL"
"18","Isn't he joining the meeting today?","NULL"
"51","So like the project manager is the admin of his own business?","F"
"642","And if yes, in which form it should come across.","NULL"
"344","The question type is it's like an open question texting, but it only serves the purpose for four survey fiddlers to commit their ideas.","NULL"
"300","Let's say more like a general feedback box.","NULL"
"203","Okay.","NULL"
"466","But normally the questionnaire is already grouped by, by topic, isn't it?","NULL"
"419","There's someone calling me,","NULL"
"290","Yeah.","NULL"
"140","But I get your point on that.","NULL"
"179","And as soon as this happened, he sort of maybe gets a email that says Hey, welcome to the, to this, uh, project.","A"
"360","And that was the idea for, for the common box, but not for every question.","NULL"
"639","Yeah.","NULL"
"623","Maybe just one question, you don't have to necessarily answer it now, but maybe note it down to, to get back to me whether the reports should be exportable, for example, to, to PDF files or anything, or, or CSV.","F"
"395","I was probably just thinking this for myself, but yeah, that's good that it, that you, yeah.","NULL"
"492","I like this idea, yeah.","NULL"
"576","But that is exactly the problem, because if we don't know the languages they are going to use, we cannot hard-code anything","A"
"382","So if it's not configurable, so all these five questions can be commendable, right?","NULL"
"145","Because we need, I mean, you know, you work now in our business for quite a while, both of you, so, you know, the set of customers you already have.","NULL"
"214","Okay.","NULL"
"665","Yes, they have to be Recording.","NULL"
"380","If the manager allows, so this is also configurable?","NULL"
"211","Certainly depends on, on which exact client we're talking about.","NULL"
"217","Yeah, I mean that, there are a lot of unclear, um, topics still.","NULL"
"630","So a manager can just decide, well, I want to share this report in form of PDF.","F"
"414","Now as a manager, I would have to, to come and take the information from anywhere, right?","NULL"
"259","Would be nice.","NULL"
"86","By the way you guys can, can you, I hear some really strange noise in the back.","NULL"
"507","Yeah. I would have that I would have to, to also dive in and, and make an estimation for,","NULL"
"589","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"347","But if you start with open text, then depends on what you want to do, but maybe you have to go up until natural language processing, which can get quite cumbersome.","NULL"
"365","Well, I can do that.","NULL"
"496","What do you guys think about, make about creating an adjustable report?","NULL"
"95","Um, so yeah, like, uh, maybe we, we have this top manager, the project manager, and then typically in the company, we would also have like sub sub-ministries, right.","F"
"539","And also in the survey interface, you can fill out the questions.","F"
"337","It's like the manager then will be like a first filter that filters out.","F"
"619","I mean, I think we are at the we're at a very good point.","NULL"
"119","So, uh, I think he should be able to see all the, uh, the surveys from the normal metrics by business unit.","F"
"330","Do we have to leave this to the manager?","NULL"
"134","Okay.","NULL"
"60","Right.","NULL"
"40","So they just sign up in order to use the services and, um, the service as itself.","F"
"655","I certainly come back to you.","NULL"
"48","I mean, is there a regular admin?","NULL"
"71","Or do you have any questions just before we go into detail now, do you guys have any questions overall?","NULL"
"135","Maybe this, this is a good point because maybe we, as a, as a developer of the software could also offer like predefined accents, which I don't know, apply to some sort of best practice or make it increase the usability and also sell these kinds of pack.","NULL"
"511","Then again, customization brings a certain instability to the responsive design, because we can probably not predict how it's going to look.","NULL"
"570","I think so, yeah.","NULL"
"620","I got a lot of very good feedback from you guys.","NULL"
"473","Exactly.","NULL"
"453","And then we should probably group not really group the question and group.","NULL"
"560","Since then I may be a follow-up question if we don't know prior.","NULL"
"506","That what I'm worried about is how, how we are going to represent the state of the overview, as in where, when, how do we define how the report looks, where each widget is placed?","NULL"
"368","Yeah.","NULL"
"617","I mean like a really nice coupling also from the front and backend that allows scalability.","A"
"136","I mean, this is just one example, but let's sort of sell predefine them project setups to our customers.","F"
"111","What if he has every survey available?","F"
"626","It may be, I mean, there will be a lot of graphical elements in such a report like charts and yeah.","F"
"429","Yeah, last week, last Friday.","NULL"
"78","And if there are questions we'll go with.","NULL"
"242","And then, uh, one can take the, the question that is depicted like a card and can just swipe it to the area wherever you want.","F"
"558","We really have to think about this actually, because my wish needs that it's, that the language can be, or the available language to the project have to be set when we, as a super admin, create the project for a customer, right?","F"
"194","Maybe, maybe the, the language settings, as you said, or maybe he belongs to different business units.","NULL"
"47","Um, by the way, why super admin?","NULL"
"311","And then maybe the teams like, Oh yeah, we all need the espresso machine.","NULL"
"397","Otherwise it would get completely out of hand.","NULL"
"610","Okay.","NULL"
"482","So these should be quick, quick and reoccurring service.","NULL"
"320","I just see one problem, because if I'm the first one to complete the survey, I won't get to see the questions or the bring ups from the other people that take the survey afterwards.","A"
"20","I think we agreed that we were going to do this on our own, the three of us.","NULL"
"568","I mean, I was just also the other day I was searching the net and I found DeepL this translation API, and maybe it would also be possible to include some sort of deeper API as in if a manager or now if a user creates an English question, people will automatically translate it to German storing the germ part of this question.","F"
"510","Because it has to be viewable on different devices.","F"
"378","So people can, if the manager allows command specific questions, which I really liked this skip some sort of inclusion,","F"
"163","I will just get an email?","F"
"457","Sorry, scale question.","NULL"
"612","I mean, that's also, that's quite important for you and your team.","NULL"
"130","Yeah.","NULL"
"182","I think Mark, you, you, you have the right track on this.","NULL"
"142","Yeah.","NULL"
"574","I think they have to be hard coded in different languages actually.","A"
"93","Maybe it's just simply, can you mute your mic if you're saying something?","NULL"
"376","We also need to talk about the reporting specifically.","NULL"
"250","Okay.","NULL"
"411","One is an, I don't know, open text question.","NULL"
"577","Yeah. But, but if we have to limit the language anyway, I mean, look at our customers, we have to.","A"
"450","Let's say a survey can only contain so many questions.","A"
"501","I think honestly, I don't know.","NULL"
"585","Not, not every user has to specify own Spanish translation to be global.","A"
"528","So you use it just to make the reporting responsive so you can always view what's happening.","F"
"235","Perfect.","NULL"
"517","On an iPad, I think, yes.","F"
"377","I mean, now I really liked that here with the swipe question, I, I wrote this down and also to comment the ability of questions.","NULL"
"345","So just keep in mind, open text is evil.","NULL"
"69","I mean, do you have the overall idea of the, of the project, right?","NULL"
"252","But, but we would have to, to, to maybe restrict that on the mobile devices.","A"
"307","So the users should have the possibility to bring in their own ideas, should the manager have missed them.","F"
"595","So these three languages will be available at the very last launch of the software.","A"
"532","Let me know what this,","NULL"
"410","But one is a swipe question.","NULL"
"366","Yeah.","NULL"
"65","Then on, on the front end side, you can simple check on with which users, uh, you are logged in currently, which roles they have, and then you can simply for each element checked through for which roles it should be displayed.","F"
"452","So maybe let's say a survey can maximum at the, at the maximum contain 10 questions.","A"
"650","I mean, the other thing is also quite interesting, but at this point, I think a bit overkill, I liked the idea, but we also move this really, really in the back of the priority list.","NULL"
"621","Maybe we should leave it at that for now because I have another meeting, which I have to attend soon.","NULL"
"4","Um, I will, if it's all right with you guys, I will just give you a quick overview, but what has been going so far and I will be needing your inputs on, on, on the specific requirements.","NULL"
"141","Technically it should be possible to do so.","NULL"
"200","Nonetheless, Is there just a single one or are there multiple?","NULL"
"247","Cool.","NULL"
"582","For English you would translate it into a different word and maybe someone wants to do Spanish, but they will have to provide a translation for Spanish, but we can simply register this translation.","F"
"177","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"32","Exactly.","NULL"
"644","I think they just want to have nice widgets, which they can include in their internal meetings or yeah.","F"
"469","Yeah, of course.","NULL"
"625","Yeah, I think the report should be shareable in some form.","F"
"137","Yeah.","NULL"
"118","Yeah, I think this would be a good approach.","NULL"
"615","So keep that in mind too.","NULL"
"401","Maybe you guys have some ideas, otherwise I'll give you mine.","NULL"
"616","Yeah.","NULL"
"68","I think it's more important that we actually talk about the different roles too.","F"
"291","Um, yeah, I'm not sure we somehow have to include that the ideas of, of the survey fillers and then these ideas can sort of be displayed to all the other people that are part of the survey.","A"
"484","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"432","Uh, I wouldn't say yeah.","NULL"
"106","Maybe we have to think about this.","NULL"
"224","I mean, let's say a manager, a manager creates a survey.","NULL"
"662","Okay, all right.","NULL"
"164","Uh, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"549","Yeah, so that's","NULL"
"472","But on the other side, who wants to fill out the questionnaire, which takes roughly 30 minutes?","NULL"
"64","I mean, you, you, you create you in internally, you created a different users with which you can assign some, some specific role.","F"
"425","What about you?","NULL"
"487","That's actually the exact input I was hoping for, because I mean, technically you, if, if within the same survey you have different topics for some reason, technically you could assign ma as in a group to, to the questions so that it would be possible to, to then in the report group by, by these question groups for, for the results.","NULL"
"185","Chris makes, makes a lot of sense because of the stuff you mentioned.","NULL"
"645","You know, you know?","NULL"
"500","I think, I don't know if the programming part will be a lot more complicated.","NULL"
"480","But here it's just together a claims like the manager really wants to fill the polls of his team in a specific topic.","NULL"
"373","Um, yeah, but maybe, maybe I have to think about this more anyways.","NULL"
"599","Depends on how extensive it gets.","NULL"
"176","I mean, actually I really like what Mark said.","NULL"
"126","Uh, I didn't get to think about this, but probably predefined would be easy to manage.","F"
"117","So as to only see, what's really important for him to see at this very moment, but if you want to, can see all.","NULL"
"66","Okay.","NULL"
"274","Hm.","NULL"
"442","All right guys.","NULL"
"72","Uh, for me, I think it's clear.","NULL"
"340","I mean, maybe, maybe you would want to say more to explain on why you like, or don't like this, what, what is there out of your mind?","NULL"
"467","Should be.","NULL"
"545","Yeah.","NULL"
"39","We have really staffs how this payment bottles should work, but it should be a recurring payment model.","F"
"255","Okay.","NULL"
"216","I mean, are there specifics we, we need to discuss or that they're unclear or.","NULL"
"139","I'm not going to talk you out of it because you're, you're the business leader on this, but just think about the generalization, if, if it, if it is possible, if it makes sense?","NULL"
"606","Yeah, I think we have to keep it simple here as well for this project phase one and just go with three languages, German, English, and French and French, and just make sure that at the launch day, these languages are implemented completely.","F"
"391","Okay, yeah, okay.","NULL"
"374","I mean, this is already, you really need degree, the detail work we're doing here.","NULL"
"618","Yeah.","NULL"
"189","Well, with the user accounts that is actually I think more ideal because then we can actually like pinpoint to specific users and it's not an email floating around somewhere.","NULL"
"352","Okay.","NULL"
"28","So did you receive that, uh, initial project document to which I've sent you?","NULL"
"367","Okay.","NULL"
"370","Me, I, as a manager can get feedback in whether people liked and understood the question or not.","F"
"444","I, yeah, I really had to take this phone call.","NULL"
"519","And then there is like a neat dashboard or something that he has on his iPad, which is like some starting screen, or I don't know.","F"
"288","And maybe, I don't know, you know, where.","NULL"
"533","I think for the beginning, this would surely be enough.","NULL"
"158","If I can talk here, maybe we could just send them an invite by email, like on the company email or an internal email?","F"
"403","So some question types are, um, better to be displayed in a specific way.","NULL"
"542","Yeah.","NULL"
"354","So let's somehow include in the next survey.","NULL"
"151","Okay.","NULL"
"33","You'd have to tap into this a bit.","NULL"
"264","Yeah.","NULL"
"521","Maybe not the iPhone, but at least the tablets.","F"
"5","I mean, you have already seen the email probably about, um, the, this tool we are planning to create, right?","NULL"
"551","Yeah, please go ahead.","NULL"
"547","If we could nail this for phase one, actually, yeah.","A"
"319","It's such a comment.","NULL"
"187","Because then we don't have to manage like, see, a thousands and billions of user accounts.","NULL"
"664","Thank you and have a nice day.","NULL"
"257","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"10","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"298","Just, just to clarify this, this, if I understood this correctly, this is about users pitching new survey questions.","NULL"
"287","They should not just be there in click to questions they should of bringing in their own ideas, which in turns can then be seen by other users.","F"
"174","Maybe what's important is, uh, I mean, we have some customers with different which are based in different countries, right.","NULL"
"407","Just like maybe all the open text questions are grouped together in the report and all other types of questions are also grouped together,","A"
"475","I also didn't.","NULL"
"286","You know, like I would really like it if you have something like they have on Reddit or somewhere like where you could maybe also as a, you somehow have to involve the users into the survey.","F"
"584","But this, the Spanish translation has to be valid for all future Spanish companies that join our software as well, right?","NULL"
"110","I mean, depending on how big this entire thing gets, maybe he simply has too many surveys to manage and loses track of what is important.","F"
"175","So we also have to consider language settings for users. I'm not really sure how we could address this problem.","A"
"160","So they're just having an account such that, uh, the managers can send them, uh, uh, emails, you know what I mean?","F"
"635","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"45","I mean, we need some, some, uh, sort of, um, possibility to manage this entire tool.","F"
"404","I think maybe for the swipe questions, we can have some, some, uh, a bar graph that shows the sides they swiped to.","F"
"188","Yeah.","NULL"
"622","So I show it, just clarify some, some more things that might be unclear for you, because from my side, I'm quite happy with our outcome of this meeting.","NULL"
"328","Well maybe, maybe we could include them in the, you know, at the end of the survey, a report is created out of this survey, which lists the results of the different questions, right?","F"
"292","And these people can then decide if these are good ideas or not.","NULL"
"657","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"428","It's really tough when","NULL"
"168","That's what I meant.","NULL"
"150","I think that's already quite a good input.","NULL"
"201","We could talk about, I think there should be the possibility to have multiple.","A"
"270","So like the answers, Hey, that's what you answered to use submit this.","NULL"
"227","I mean, we could probably just stick to our, to our typical survey model where we have scale questions with, with disliking scale and we have open tax questions and we have multiple and single choice questions, right.","F"
"572","One is the interactive part, which should be translated for, for the users between them.","F"
"580","Let's say you have the translation code, which should the books scale.","NULL"
"458","One of the survey, we will get its own way too in the report.","NULL"
"74","Yeah.","NULL"
"369","I mean, I really liked the idea of making questions commendable like that.","NULL"
"459","And then all the other scale questions are in the same area of the report.","F"
"322","That's for sure a big problem.","NULL"
"385","Okay, okay, yep.","NULL"
"548","I just put this here in the projects goals, you guys see it in the documents I'll share afterwards, but that's that's yeah, that that's, that would be a really important.","NULL"
"104","Um, so I wonder, I wonder if, if it makes sense that, that a project manager should be able to also see and maybe even be able to add it surveys from managers below him, or should he just exclusively, um, be able to manage his own service?","F"
"23","Oh yeah, right.","NULL"
"491","Yes.","NULL"
"488","I don't know how much sense this makes, but I think it, it should be possible from a technical aspect.","NULL"
"609","And then maybe just keep the possibility in the backlog, but that's certainly not for phase one.","F"
"236","Um, yeah, I noted some types of questions here in preparation for this awesome meeting.","NULL"
"591","Yeah.","NULL"
"372","So he can really add new ideas or innovative ideas, or maybe even this way, patients, which then can generally be seen by others and the opera download it.","F"
"608","Okay.","NULL"
"61","Because we really need to think about how, um, to distribute rights in order to, to only show specific information to specific roles.","F"
"133","Yeah.","NULL"
"25","I haven't seen this email.","NULL"
"79","Yeah.","NULL"
"421","Well fine so far.","NULL"
"523","Maybe because you, you need also a good input device, like a keyboard or something, because if you create new employees or new questions, you need to type a bit of text,","F"
"232","I mean, the types of questions I just mentioned there, everyone knows them, but maybe we could come up with something innovative, which will be a unique selling point for our application.","NULL"
"114","Maybe, I don't know.","NULL"
"266","I mean, I don't know how, you know, the functionality, but sometimes if you just try swiping through and then you realize, Oh, that was the wrong side.","NULL"
"218","I mean, we just talked about those now more or less, but I mean, and, and also now about the communication, so just let me briefly get, um, pinpoint this down.","NULL"
"516","I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?","F&A"
"424","It's always.","NULL"
"332","And then that then remains the question with, with the voting.","A"
"143","Right.","NULL"
"493","I like this idea.","NULL"
"276","Yeah, I like that.","NULL"
"209","Yeah.","NULL"
"476","I really, yeah, I'm really sorry.","NULL"
"329","So the math, maybe, maybe we put.","NULL"
"624","I don't know, because for now what we were talking about is that is all online in a widget or somewhere, but maybe, maybe you, he also has to report to someone else and would require it to as a file.","F"
"233","Um, I cannot hear you both.","NULL"
"554","I think in the beginning somewhere you were talking about languages two questions, one to the business side, as in what languages are there is there a default language or how, how do we handle this?","NULL"
"3","Uh, let me just quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"633","I get the message for really bad network quality.","NULL"
"237","So first, uh, I would, I thought about open text questions.","F"
"197","And this again would be like a hierarchy that we will have to store and to represent somewhere.","A"
"339","But then, then I would maybe I know how, how from the, from the UX perspective, this goes, but like simple swipe would not be sufficient for this.","NULL"
"463","I think it's impossible to sort of group the questions by, by meaning of the question for this week.","NULL"
"355","That's all, there shouldn't be any, um, post-processing of these ideas.","NULL"
"41","It's like, um, an online application that has different user roles.","F"
"109","Um, I'm, I'm thinking more of a, of a usage issue.","NULL"
"333","Um, maybe we could do it that way.","NULL"
"63","I don't think that should be that much of a problem.","NULL"
"16","Where the hell did I put my, um, my notes?","NULL"
"406","What do you think about this?","NULL"
"325","Maybe we can collect these questions and make us a follow-up survey, which then, or something like that in the end.","F"
"593","I mean, I like this, but probably you should, we should just start with the English German French set, because the most of our customers are either one of these.","F"
"29","Just, uh, the one that briefly describes our mission about this project.","NULL"
"75","Um, from my side, I think it is mostly clear.","NULL"
"278","That's actually a really cool idea, but the answer yeah.","NULL"
"449","So it's not really getting messy.","NULL"
"9","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"565","Yeah, I see.","NULL"
"460","Then we have the same for open text question, multiple single choice and so on.","NULL"
"338","The really unnecessary I listen is in his opinion, from the really nice things which he sees worth sharing.","NULL"
"562","And from previous projects where I think we handled it the way that our client had to provide translations for the languages they wanted, where we just sent them, Hey, there are the terms like the, these these words and sentences.","F"
"579","I don't know what you mean by that.","NULL"
"598","So for sure they don't want to provide additional work in order to be able to use it","NULL"
"494","That's, that's something I just noted it down, but something we have to keep in mind and go more into that.","NULL"
"154","I'm wondering, do you think it is necessary for users to even have like a in or something?","NULL"
"180","And from there on, he will receive mails, but all this language setting stuff, maybe shouldn't concern that the user, I mean, with user, I mean the survey filler, right?","NULL"
"152","I mean, there, there will also of course be this, the role of the employee or of the servery filler him or herself, right.","F"
"555","Yep.","NULL"
"405","And for all the questions we can have all the types, but all in all, I would say for the, um, usability or visibility of the results, it would be good to, to group the question types together.","F"
"541","That's also really important.","NULL"
"308","So maybe me as a user can just submit that.","F"
"348","No, but I think we sh we wouldn't have to go that far.","NULL"
"279","Bring your others as well.","NULL"
"83","So, um, typically the company there will be, uh, like our manager, like, uh, some sort of top manager, maybe, I don't know, maybe a project manager will be suitable word.","F"
"44","So this will be asked.","NULL"
"540","This should also be specifically responsive so that all the costumers can fill out the surveys wherever they are.","F"
"400","So I'm not sure here how we should actually display the results of these different questions.","NULL"
"231","Yeah, we need something fancy looking and also something innovative.","A"
"92","No, no, that's okay.","NULL"
"226","What kind of question makes sense in it?","NULL"
"101","Yeah.","NULL"
"312","That's a great idea.","NULL"
"88","Yeah.","NULL"
"556","I think it would make sense to have a default language for approach check.","F"
"434","But what about symptoms?","NULL"
"363","So the comment will be on this question specifically.","NULL"
"346","As in, if you have simple possibilities, then the processing is also simple.","NULL"
"302","But not channel it's channel in terms of the survey, let's say a survey is about user satisfaction or umm, employee motivation.","NULL"
"220","This is solely the, um, the task of a manager.","A"
"52","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"531","I mean, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"398","And also the report that results out of survey will be really messed up and bloated with, if every question cook will be commendable, I mean, maybe we can just use this to transition to the reporting system because that's also something which should be like the part of, of course, from an ice service to this, this is really important to, right.","NULL"
"381","Yeah, it definitely has to be configurable because otherwise let's say I, as a manager, create the survey, complaining five questions.","F"
"230","What looks fancy?","NULL"
"146","I mean, we ha we, we don't, we have a lot of customers, but it's still quite, um, well, it's, we, we don't serve the whole world.","NULL"
"326","But then you get two emails.","NULL"
"454","Yeah.","NULL"
"42","And depending on your user role, you have different rights.","F"
"387","Yeah.","NULL"
"443","Sorry, I'm back.","NULL"
"96","Like maybe a team miniature or some sort of friend business unit manager.","F"
"316","But I don't really see how this should be working, right.","NULL"
"359","Or, or explain why you don't like it.","NULL"
"515","I would have to collaborate on this, yeah.","NULL"
"98","Depends on what they should be able to do.","NULL"
"441","Okay.","NULL"
"273","That's, that will be really important there.","NULL"
"37","But now we want to have a means that our customers can easily and without much effort create service from wherever they are using their mobile device or also their notebook, whatever, you know, it's just currently in all the survey basis, it's like a trend to ease up the process of creating new service.","F"
"172","I mean, are there additional configuration issues or any other thing that we would require users for?","NULL"
"212","But I think I get you a general concept.","NULL"
"661","So I'll just stack get all this information in a readable document and I'll provide you with it.","NULL"
"267","Is there intended to be a functionality to retrieve a card?","F"
"526","So like the, the actual configuration would probably happen on a, on a desktop or laptop, but for, for the single reporting, if you are in a meeting, you have your iPad with you.","NULL"
"123","I don't really understand this.","NULL"
"26","Um, so yeah.","NULL"
"509","I mean, that's, that's good that you mentioned the point of, of, of how it actually should look in there because here, we also have to keep in mind that the design of this tool has to be responsive, right.","A"
"341","Is there a, an approach for this?","NULL"
"495","That's that's a really good idea.","NULL"
"115","Maybe Mark, you can get some important because you have probably the best knowledge about user experience.","NULL"
"100","How much is there to abstract?","NULL"
"207","Normally you would have like at most, maybe one project manager, which corresponds or communicates with the human resources department of the business and that's about it, right.","NULL"
"564","Would that make sense?","NULL"
"438","My friends it's the only rough, but otherwise probably same as me.","NULL"
"465","Yeah, I think you're somewhat right.","NULL"
"94","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"193","Yeah.","NULL"
"221","So, uh, let me just quickly write this down here.","NULL"
"503","So it shouldn't be so much of an issue to move these blocks around, right?","NULL"
"295","So technically, I mean, we, we have a timeframe of around six months for this phase one, so I'm not sure if this is all working, maybe only you can.","NULL"
"420","How's your life going?","NULL"
"275","Okay.","NULL"
"55","That makes sense.","NULL"
"479","Like otherwise, if someone really wants to create the, in that survey, even use our other services, we have flooded with a lot of them on our home page to create a really full flex drownded survey.","NULL"
"210","Yeah.","NULL"
"498","Yeah.","NULL"
"77","Um, yeah, I think, I think I got, I got most of the parts, so let's, let's start.","NULL"
"324","I don't know.","NULL"
"34","Yeah.","NULL"
"297","Um, I think just for the technical side, it should, of course be possible, but I'm not sure about budget or time scope.","NULL"
"161","What I want to say.","NULL"
"59","So, I mean, of course there are like you have to properly already, um, think of how, how we possibly can reflect such a hierarchical, um, role system in a technical way.","F"
"520","But certainly it makes sense.","NULL"
"417","I'm thinking actually, but I, yeah, I haven't really thought about this specific scenario, which is quite an important one.","NULL"
"629","I'm sorry, I didn't get that.","NULL"
"392","But, but nice to know that it should have this flag.","F"
"36","So yeah, I mean that overall wish actually is to extend our, um, services, you know, as for now our costumer mainly, um, fill out service your post or over the, um, portal, which we've set up last year.","NULL"
"153","Because let's say a manager runs the survey, so you will receive the survey in some form and then be able to fill it out.","F"
"73","There's just some, some small stuff that we need to specify, but, uh, I think that's the reason why we have this meeting in the end.","NULL"
"435","No, nothing.","NULL"
"390","And then this is a simple flag displayed or not displayed.","F"
"490","Yeah, it makes sense.","NULL"
"147","So I think maybe, yeah, maybe it will make sense to sort of come up with the generalized, um, set of texts.","A"
"651","Yeah, I think I'm good.","NULL"
"641","Whereas let's say a CSV file simply contain the data, which is in the charts, but just let me know if, if there is the requirement to do so.","F"
"314","Okay.","NULL"
"646","Yeah, makes sense.","NULL"
"81","Okay.","NULL"
"578","No, technically we don't have to, we can hard-code translation, codes, and then simply register translations for these codes.","A"
"148","But I mean, I already liked the idea of text.","NULL"
"513","I'm not sure.","NULL"
"660","So yeah, I think it's, you, you both have a good overview now and you'll hear from me soon.","NULL"
"306","Maybe he asks them what motivates you most at work.","NULL"
"409","I mean, what if let's, let's say you have, um, out of 10 questions in your survey, you have three questions regarding, uh, let's say communication within the team and these three questions they are related.","NULL"
"343","Or making maybe, maybe we should just create a new question type.","NULL"
"315","So yes, exactly.","NULL"
"246","You can just use the mouse cursor and drag the cart to the, to the area.","A"
"437","Maybe a little cough.","NULL"
"656","Trust me.","NULL"
"241","At the bottom side is, I don't know, or I don't care.","F"
"427","Oh yeah?","NULL"
"19","No, he is not.","NULL"
"296","Honestly I cannot say just out of my head, I guess I would have to like do that.","NULL"
"289","So you mean like in the end of the survey, you can have, uh, some of that somewhat the first question creator and, uh, the, the guys of the survey of the guys that they decided to be off, the roads can agree to this or, or something like that.","F"
"62","Yeah.","NULL"
"396","That we are now found the concepts about this, because this will be a really, really important feature.","NULL"
"196","So as to assign, um, which team leader can interact with which employees, so where, where does, where do they belong in, in the hierarchy or maybe even from the project manager side, uh, which team leaders belong to this, uh, project manager.","F"
"208","You don't need a lot of, I mean, we, we talk, um, top level managers of a business here probably to be overkill if, if a business would have more than one managing this, this, this little, um, aspect of the business, right.","NULL"
"171","We already have that, but two, we actually need to have underlying users.","F"
"263","Because this is already really, it was just a really idea actually.","NULL"
"586","So once the Spanish has been done.","NULL"
"99","Yeah.","NULL"
"21","Uh, this information didn't reach me, but, uh, that's fine with me.","NULL"
"254","Right.","NULL"
"280","It's the scale question, like some engagement questions and like that, uh, they can only be used to measure engagement or engagement related topics.","F"
"364","Yeah.","NULL"
"234","I think you're both muted, but maybe, maybe, so maybe Mark, can you hear me now?","NULL"
"571","But now, well, I would give the admin the possibility to correct the translation at least, but just, just as we clear, we are now talking about two different things.","F"
"49","No, actually there, there isn't, I mean, super admin.","NULL"
"46","Right.","NULL"
"170","If, if you're talking about, we simply send an email, I mean, you could just, um, specify a list of emails and that's fine.","F"
"260","Yeah.","NULL"
"658","For sure.","NULL"
"157","Yeah.","NULL"
"402","Um, yeah, I have a small, um, how should I say I thought about this and maybe we talked about the different, uh, types of questions.","NULL"
"173","Yeah.","NULL"
"353","This idea of user one is nice.","NULL"
"238","Like everybody knows them, uh, of course single and multiple choice questions, and maybe we can also add something like swipe questions so that you can have maybe a left-hand side, the right-hand side and a button bottom side.","F"
