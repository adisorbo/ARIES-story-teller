"id","req_specification","class"
"100","How much is there to abstract?","NULL"
"600","Yeah.","NULL"
"227","I mean, we could probably just stick to our, to our typical survey model where we have scale questions with, with disliking scale and we have open tax questions and we have multiple and single choice questions, right.","F"
"549","Yeah, so that's","NULL"
"156","How do you have any ideas on how we could actually bring the survey to the employees on a most simple way?","NULL"
"124","Um, like, um, the, the content of the survey, so maybe it's about employee happiness or customer satisfaction, and we can use texts.","F"
"608","Okay.","NULL"
"620","I got a lot of very good feedback from you guys.","NULL"
"367","Okay.","NULL"
"220","This is solely the, um, the task of a manager.","A"
"591","Yeah.","NULL"
"442","All right guys.","NULL"
"356","The reason I am saying this is, I'm not sure if, if we make every question, comment, the bolus you guys suggest to","NULL"
"288","And maybe, I don't know, you know, where.","NULL"
"9","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"489","So just like to, to Mark different parts of the survey, similar to the tasks, similar to the texts, you, you can create a group and then assign, let's say three questions to this group, but in the entire survey you'll have up to eight questions.","F"
"195","So we would need, uh, maybe this part.","NULL"
"414","Now as a manager, I would have to, to come and take the information from anywhere, right?","NULL"
"433","I'm sitting at home all the time","NULL"
"574","I think they have to be hard coded in different languages actually.","A"
"281","But maybe I have, yeah.","NULL"
"312","That's a great idea.","NULL"
"642","And if yes, in which form it should come across.","NULL"
"454","Yeah.","NULL"
"616","Yeah.","NULL"
"383","So I want to configure it.","NULL"
"415","Yeah, totally see this point, maybe Chris, can you elaborate or, okay.","NULL"
"355","That's all, there shouldn't be any, um, post-processing of these ideas.","NULL"
"86","By the way you guys can, can you, I hear some really strange noise in the back.","NULL"
"440","I thought it was, it was kind of, kind of a joke, but if it weren't for Corona, I would have gone to work without any problems, honestly.","NULL"
"563","Are there, can you translate them?","NULL"
"434","But what about symptoms?","NULL"
"123","I don't really understand this.","NULL"
"42","And depending on your user role, you have different rights.","F"
"646","Yeah, makes sense.","NULL"
"57","Yeah.","NULL"
"643","I think PDF is fine for now because otherwise our customers would really be interested in data science of this particular specific surveys, which I highly doubt actually.","F"
"659","We have to reschedule many more meetings also just with you and your team Janik and Mark with, with the designers as well.","NULL"
"283","So, okay.","NULL"
"44","So this will be asked.","NULL"
"307","So the users should have the possibility to bring in their own ideas, should the manager have missed them.","F"
"194","Maybe, maybe the, the language settings, as you said, or maybe he belongs to different business units.","NULL"
"219","So I would really like it, if an employee doesn't have to do any, it doesn't have to do anything to, to be part of a project.","A"
"182","I think Mark, you, you, you have the right track on this.","NULL"
"357","I was not, I was not talking about every question, but for, for the follow-up survey, but for, for, for when you can like, or dislike, uh, other ideas, or maybe you want to add something to it","F"
"106","Maybe we have to think about this.","NULL"
"400","So I'm not sure here how we should actually display the results of these different questions.","NULL"
"79","Yeah.","NULL"
"540","This should also be specifically responsive so that all the costumers can fill out the surveys wherever they are.","F"
"323","So maybe, yeah.","NULL"
"636","So what's this, what's this your question?","NULL"
"588","Then it will be blah, blah, blah, for all future Spanish customers, right?","F"
"539","And also in the survey interface, you can fill out the questions.","F"
"172","I mean, are there additional configuration issues or any other thing that we would require users for?","NULL"
"19","No, he is not.","NULL"
"101","Yeah.","NULL"
"135","Maybe this, this is a good point because maybe we, as a, as a developer of the software could also offer like predefined accents, which I don't know, apply to some sort of best practice or make it increase the usability and also sell these kinds of pack.","NULL"
"507","Yeah. I would have that I would have to, to also dive in and, and make an estimation for,","NULL"
"154","I'm wondering, do you think it is necessary for users to even have like a in or something?","NULL"
"518","I mean, think about, think about the manager who's often walking around or visiting different I don't know, departments, and instead of laptops, they have iPads.","NULL"
"535","Yes.","NULL"
"324","I don't know.","NULL"
"422","It's a little early, but I manage.","NULL"
"368","Yeah.","NULL"
"104","Um, so I wonder, I wonder if, if it makes sense that, that a project manager should be able to also see and maybe even be able to add it surveys from managers below him, or should he just exclusively, um, be able to manage his own service?","F"
"362","I can say this question should be commented.","F"
"436","Yeah.","NULL"
"665","Yes, they have to be Recording.","NULL"
"570","I think so, yeah.","NULL"
"373","Um, yeah, but maybe, maybe I have to think about this more anyways.","NULL"
"181","Like an employee or what do you think?","NULL"
"149","Anyway, I know that this data, we can go into more detail on this later on.","NULL"
"352","Okay.","NULL"
"605","That I expect that the tool is a way otherwise it's already ran another tool.","NULL"
"53","If you have a business hierarchy of a bit of, of a specific company, then let's say the top manager board, they will typically, some of them are maybe only one of the top managers will be the project manager of a project because he will sort of manage all the subordinates business units.","F"
"161","What I want to say.","NULL"
"89","Uh, this, my mother [inaudible], um, she's finished in two minutes.","NULL"
"81","Okay.","NULL"
"335","So he, at the end, in the report, he sees all the feedback of the users, but then he himself can decide which of these he liked.","A"
"256","So on mobile devices, you can only swipe using the touch functionality.","A"
"32","Exactly.","NULL"
"511","Then again, customization brings a certain instability to the responsive design, because we can probably not predict how it's going to look.","NULL"
"431","So, so now you're, you're sitting at home enjoying your life or?","NULL"
"2","I know.","NULL"
"258","That makes total sense actually, but yeah.","NULL"
"358","Right.","NULL"
"338","The really unnecessary I listen is in his opinion, from the really nice things which he sees worth sharing.","NULL"
"185","Chris makes, makes a lot of sense because of the stuff you mentioned.","NULL"
"603","Yeah.","NULL"
"211","Certainly depends on, on which exact client we're talking about.","NULL"
"174","Maybe what's important is, uh, I mean, we have some customers with different which are based in different countries, right.","NULL"
"452","So maybe let's say a survey can maximum at the, at the maximum contain 10 questions.","A"
"385","Okay, okay, yep.","NULL"
"259","Would be nice.","NULL"
"592","That's, that's really important.","NULL"
"268","Yeah.","NULL"
"376","We also need to talk about the reporting specifically.","NULL"
"48","I mean, is there a regular admin?","NULL"
"253","Yeah, no, no, no, not the swipe, but the click, you mean that you accidentally clicked somewhere.","NULL"
"350","So the manager sees, okay, user one set, blah, blah, blah, user two set blah, blah, blah, nothing more than that.","NULL"
"316","But I don't really see how this should be working, right.","NULL"
"488","I don't know how much sense this makes, but I think it, it should be possible from a technical aspect.","NULL"
"364","Yeah.","NULL"
"398","And also the report that results out of survey will be really messed up and bloated with, if every question cook will be commendable, I mean, maybe we can just use this to transition to the reporting system because that's also something which should be like the part of, of course, from an ice service to this, this is really important to, right.","NULL"
"346","As in, if you have simple possibilities, then the processing is also simple.","NULL"
"179","And as soon as this happened, he sort of maybe gets a email that says Hey, welcome to the, to this, uh, project.","A"
"136","I mean, this is just one example, but let's sort of sell predefine them project setups to our customers.","F"
"16","Where the hell did I put my, um, my notes?","NULL"
"628","So maybe to make sense to, to make it available.","F"
"424","It's always.","NULL"
"635","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"311","And then maybe the teams like, Oh yeah, we all need the espresso machine.","NULL"
"403","So some question types are, um, better to be displayed in a specific way.","NULL"
"363","So the comment will be on this question specifically.","NULL"
"186","So from a technical point of view, Janik, it will be probably easiest that way, right?","NULL"
"647","Okay, I'll note that.","NULL"
"587","So for example, scale question is blah, blah, blah.","NULL"
"462","It's, it's his job to make sense out of this data.","NULL"
"4","Um, I will, if it's all right with you guys, I will just give you a quick overview, but what has been going so far and I will be needing your inputs on, on, on the specific requirements.","NULL"
"536","I mean, we can choose an approach, which would make the global possibility for responsive design, but maybe just not in detail implemented on each side.","A"
"275","Okay.","NULL"
"35","Cool.","NULL"
"655","I certainly come back to you.","NULL"
"585","Not, not every user has to specify own Spanish translation to be global.","A"
"250","Okay.","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","A"
"506","That what I'm worried about is how, how we are going to represent the state of the overview, as in where, when, how do we define how the report looks, where each widget is placed?","NULL"
"522","I have, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"36","So yeah, I mean that overall wish actually is to extend our, um, services, you know, as for now our costumer mainly, um, fill out service your post or over the, um, portal, which we've set up last year.","NULL"
"78","And if there are questions we'll go with.","NULL"
"637","What format to report?","NULL"
"83","So, um, typically the company there will be, uh, like our manager, like, uh, some sort of top manager, maybe, I don't know, maybe a project manager will be suitable word.","F"
"139","I'm not going to talk you out of it because you're, you're the business leader on this, but just think about the generalization, if, if it, if it is possible, if it makes sense?","NULL"
"538","I think that's, that's a good, a good way.","NULL"
"657","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"660","So yeah, I think it's, you, you both have a good overview now and you'll hear from me soon.","NULL"
"568","I mean, I was just also the other day I was searching the net and I found DeepL this translation API, and maybe it would also be possible to include some sort of deeper API as in if a manager or now if a user creates an English question, people will automatically translate it to German storing the germ part of this question.","F"
"464","We will have to include really complicated the algorithms, maybe even NLP or something, which should be way out of scope.","NULL"
"611","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"353","This idea of user one is nice.","NULL"
"202","So they are just all on the top level and its like a pool of project managers and the top level and out of this pool, those, the entire structure or hierarchy of the business.","A"
"127","You can select of a certain group.","F"
"85","Maybe we can talk about the naming later on.","NULL"
"494","That's, that's something I just noted it down, but something we have to keep in mind and go more into that.","NULL"
"130","Yeah.","NULL"
"658","For sure.","NULL"
"187","Because then we don't have to manage like, see, a thousands and billions of user accounts.","NULL"
"266","I mean, I don't know how, you know, the functionality, but sometimes if you just try swiping through and then you realize, Oh, that was the wrong side.","NULL"
"298","Just, just to clarify this, this, if I understood this correctly, this is about users pitching new survey questions.","NULL"
"265","Just a quick input.","NULL"
"212","But I think I get you a general concept.","NULL"
"133","Yeah.","NULL"
"432","Uh, I wouldn't say yeah.","NULL"
"467","Should be.","NULL"
"46","Right.","NULL"
"423","Stressful day.","NULL"
"633","I get the message for really bad network quality.","NULL"
"114","Maybe, I don't know.","NULL"
"218","I mean, we just talked about those now more or less, but I mean, and, and also now about the communication, so just let me briefly get, um, pinpoint this down.","NULL"
"492","I like this idea, yeah.","NULL"
"453","And then we should probably group not really group the question and group.","NULL"
"632","You guys hear me?","NULL"
"500","I think, I don't know if the programming part will be a lot more complicated.","NULL"
"246","You can just use the mouse cursor and drag the cart to the, to the area.","A"
"345","So just keep in mind, open text is evil.","NULL"
"180","And from there on, he will receive mails, but all this language setting stuff, maybe shouldn't concern that the user, I mean, with user, I mean the survey filler, right?","NULL"
"382","So if it's not configurable, so all these five questions can be commendable, right?","NULL"
"520","But certainly it makes sense.","NULL"
"650","I mean, the other thing is also quite interesting, but at this point, I think a bit overkill, I liked the idea, but we also move this really, really in the back of the priority list.","NULL"
"348","No, but I think we sh we wouldn't have to go that far.","NULL"
"457","Sorry, scale question.","NULL"
"351","And he can select, wow.","NULL"
"90","Should I, uh?","NULL"
"469","Yeah, of course.","NULL"
"321","True, true.","NULL"
"295","So technically, I mean, we, we have a timeframe of around six months for this phase one, so I'm not sure if this is all working, maybe only you can.","NULL"
"577","Yeah. But, but if we have to limit the language anyway, I mean, look at our customers, we have to.","A"
"618","Yeah.","NULL"
"112","Yeah.","NULL"
"425","What about you?","NULL"
"96","Like maybe a team miniature or some sort of friend business unit manager.","F"
"109","Um, I'm, I'm thinking more of a, of a usage issue.","NULL"
"110","I mean, depending on how big this entire thing gets, maybe he simply has too many surveys to manage and loses track of what is important.","F"
"189","Well, with the user accounts that is actually I think more ideal because then we can actually like pinpoint to specific users and it's not an email floating around somewhere.","NULL"
"559","So we say this project supports English and German and from French.","F"
"308","So maybe me as a user can just submit that.","F"
"141","Technically it should be possible to do so.","NULL"
"485","Like this, it would totally make sense to limit them to 10 and like this, I think there's also only one topic per, per survey.","NULL"
"391","Okay, yeah, okay.","NULL"
"460","Then we have the same for open text question, multiple single choice and so on.","NULL"
"410","But one is a swipe question.","NULL"
"93","Maybe it's just simply, can you mute your mic if you're saying something?","NULL"
"167","Yeah.","NULL"
"340","I mean, maybe, maybe you would want to say more to explain on why you like, or don't like this, what, what is there out of your mind?","NULL"
"40","So they just sign up in order to use the services and, um, the service as itself.","F"
"131","The team leaders or the employees could, could simply select out of these predefined tags.","F"
"371","I think we accidentally here hit another idea, which I didn't want to, to point at, but I think I would just track this down because I really liked the comment ability of questions, but it still doesn't really solve the problem, which I initially mentioned in as in to include the user.","NULL"
"326","But then you get two emails.","NULL"
"551","Yeah, please go ahead.","NULL"
"128","You're maybe, maybe we can say the project manager can define these texts for his company.","F"
"625","Yeah, I think the report should be shareable in some form.","F"
"629","I'm sorry, I didn't get that.","NULL"
"583","And if the user logs in with a Spanish setting, he will get the Spanish translation for it.","F"
"474","This is the point, which I think Mark, you haven't really understood.","NULL"
"602","Maybe they could even add their own translations.","F"
"267","Is there intended to be a functionality to retrieve a card?","F"
"406","What do you think about this?","NULL"
"49","No, actually there, there isn't, I mean, super admin.","NULL"
"479","Like otherwise, if someone really wants to create the, in that survey, even use our other services, we have flooded with a lot of them on our home page to create a really full flex drownded survey.","NULL"
"248","Could we just also like make, make the, the side thingy a button like that you could just, instead of swiping also just click there.","NULL"
"580","Let's say you have the translation code, which should the books scale.","NULL"
"126","Uh, I didn't get to think about this, but probably predefined would be easy to manage.","F"
"482","So these should be quick, quick and reoccurring service.","NULL"
"166","So the manager will actually create this user and then the user is sort of in the system and will receive the emails on the email address which the managers specified.","F"
"562","And from previous projects where I think we handled it the way that our client had to provide translations for the languages they wanted, where we just sent them, Hey, there are the terms like the, these these words and sentences.","F"
"310","I don't know, the espresso machine motivates me the most at work so I can submit this and then others should see this.","NULL"
"634","Okay.","NULL"
"84","Uh, let me just quickly write this down here as a side note.","NULL"
"183","Yeah.","NULL"
"589","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"645","You know, you know?","NULL"
"111","What if he has every survey available?","F"
"389","If you once built the comment box, you can simply copy paste it from, from your perspective, right?","NULL"
"77","Um, yeah, I think, I think I got, I got most of the parts, so let's, let's start.","NULL"
"545","Yeah.","NULL"
"521","Maybe not the iPhone, but at least the tablets.","F"
"472","But on the other side, who wants to fill out the questionnaire, which takes roughly 30 minutes?","NULL"
"273","That's, that will be really important there.","NULL"
"543","I think this, this should definitely be responsive.","F"
"529","For example,","NULL"
"484","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"11","Cool.","NULL"
"388","That, I mean, the, the, the functionality itself can, is easily reusable.","NULL"
"73","There's just some, some small stuff that we need to specify, but, uh, I think that's the reason why we have this meeting in the end.","NULL"
"631","Can","NULL"
"28","So did you receive that, uh, initial project document to which I've sent you?","NULL"
"151","Okay.","NULL"
"251","Yeah, that, that allows us particularly because yeah, it's made me more intuitive for, for P for computer users using a mouse.","A"
"402","Um, yeah, I have a small, um, how should I say I thought about this and maybe we talked about the different, uh, types of questions.","NULL"
"419","There's someone calling me,","NULL"
"412","And one is, uh, the scale of satisfaction, something.","NULL"
"177","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"548","I just put this here in the projects goals, you guys see it in the documents I'll share afterwards, but that's that's yeah, that that's, that would be a really important.","NULL"
"513","I'm not sure.","NULL"
"76","I mean, this is, as you said, a, a tool for, for survey management or like creation and organization and reporting.","F"
"30","The word document you mean?","NULL"
"61","Because we really need to think about how, um, to distribute rights in order to, to only show specific information to specific roles.","F"
"509","I mean, that's, that's good that you mentioned the point of, of, of how it actually should look in there because here, we also have to keep in mind that the design of this tool has to be responsive, right.","A"
"280","It's the scale question, like some engagement questions and like that, uh, they can only be used to measure engagement or engagement related topics.","F"
"652","Mark, do you have something?","NULL"
"554","I think in the beginning somewhere you were talking about languages two questions, one to the business side, as in what languages are there is there a default language or how, how do we handle this?","NULL"
"514","Maybe you can grasp this a bit better Janik, but, or maybe also you Mark as a UX specialist,","NULL"
"95","Um, so yeah, like, uh, maybe we, we have this top manager, the project manager, and then typically in the company, we would also have like sub sub-ministries, right.","F"
"465","Yeah, I think you're somewhat right.","NULL"
"65","Then on, on the front end side, you can simple check on with which users, uh, you are logged in currently, which roles they have, and then you can simply for each element checked through for which roles it should be displayed.","F"
"598","So for sure they don't want to provide additional work in order to be able to use it","NULL"
"29","Just, uh, the one that briefly describes our mission about this project.","NULL"
"205","Nah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do this at the initial, at this point of phase one of our project, because I think we should keep it simple.","Null"
"64","I mean, you, you, you create you in internally, you created a different users with which you can assign some, some specific role.","F"
"68","I think it's more important that we actually talk about the different roles too.","F"
"639","Yeah.","NULL"
"58","Um, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"165","Ah, okay.","NULL"
"517","On an iPad, I think, yes.","F"
"274","Hm.","NULL"
"155","Or how could we, how could we solve this with the survey feeling?","NULL"
"134","Okay.","NULL"
"226","What kind of question makes sense in it?","NULL"
"594","Yeah, I need one of these languages.","NULL"
"41","It's like, um, an online application that has different user roles.","F"
"501","I think honestly, I don't know.","NULL"
"199","So every other user and team leader belongs to a project manager.","A"
"206","I mean, what, what are the odds that, that accompany assigned smokable project managers to such a survey tool anyways, right.","NULL"
"567","I think that would actually make sense that we keep it like that in this tool as well.","NULL"
"203","Okay.","NULL"
"301","Exactly.","NULL"
"80","So yeah, that, that's fine.","NULL"
"234","I think you're both muted, but maybe, maybe, so maybe Mark, can you hear me now?","NULL"
"565","Yeah, I see.","NULL"
"82","So maybe let's start with the, with the user roles.","F"
"285","I should've mentioned this earlier, sorry, but maybe, maybe less about the, the actual functionality and more about the design will be really nice.","NULL"
"197","And this again would be like a hierarchy that we will have to store and to represent somewhere.","A"
"315","So yes, exactly.","NULL"
"523","Maybe because you, you need also a good input device, like a keyboard or something, because if you create new employees or new questions, you need to type a bit of text,","F"
"23","Oh yeah, right.","NULL"
"627","I mean, other bar plots and so on.","F"
"541","That's also really important.","NULL"
"343","Or making maybe, maybe we should just create a new question type.","NULL"
"504","It depends on, on how we entirely approach the thing.","NULL"
"347","But if you start with open text, then depends on what you want to do, but maybe you have to go up until natural language processing, which can get quite cumbersome.","NULL"
"427","Oh yeah?","NULL"
"255","Okay.","NULL"
"459","And then all the other scale questions are in the same area of the report.","F"
"445","This was important.","NULL"
"497","So the manager can move around the elements as he wants so he can sort of create this own sorting.","F"
"564","Would that make sense?","NULL"
"254","Right.","NULL"
"175","So we also have to consider language settings for users. I'm not really sure how we could address this problem.","A"
"571","But now, well, I would give the admin the possibility to correct the translation at least, but just, just as we clear, we are now talking about two different things.","F"
"624","I don't know, because for now what we were talking about is that is all online in a widget or somewhere, but maybe, maybe you, he also has to report to someone else and would require it to as a file.","F"
"569","I'm not sure if this is technically doable, actually,","A"
"305","So the questions evolve around motivation.","A"
"399","Because the manager, they want to be clean, clean, and easy to understand view what's happening within their survey or what are the results.","F"
"380","If the manager allows, so this is also configurable?","NULL"
"349","I mean, we could just make it so that these ideas are submitted in raw text and then, or displayed and in the report to the manager.","F"
"237","So first, uh, I would, I thought about open text questions.","F"
"207","Normally you would have like at most, maybe one project manager, which corresponds or communicates with the human resources department of the business and that's about it, right.","NULL"
"579","I don't know what you mean by that.","NULL"
"648","Yeah.","NULL"
"115","Maybe Mark, you can get some important because you have probably the best knowledge about user experience.","NULL"
"260","Yeah.","NULL"
"192","Concrete example.","NULL"
"67","Yeah, I think so too.","NULL"
"329","So the math, maybe, maybe we put.","NULL"
"334","That, yeah, it's just up to the manager, up to the manager to see what came in in this specific survey, right?","NULL"
"613","Only once you start developing the actual technical parts that this has to be highly scalable in the long run.","A"
"503","So it shouldn't be so much of an issue to move these blocks around, right?","NULL"
"332","And then that then remains the question with, with the voting.","A"
"582","For English you would translate it into a different word and maybe someone wants to do Spanish, but they will have to provide a translation for Spanish, but we can simply register this translation.","F"
"233","Um, I cannot hear you both.","NULL"
"45","I mean, we need some, some, uh, sort of, um, possibility to manage this entire tool.","F"
"125","Would that be a fully customizable tag or predefined texts?","F"
"626","It may be, I mean, there will be a lot of graphical elements in such a report like charts and yeah.","F"
"7","So let me just quickly.","NULL"
"341","Is there a, an approach for this?","NULL"
"456","So scale question, one of the reports will get its own, which is fair.","NULL"
"22","Well, it was decided yesterday.","NULL"
"14","Right.","NULL"
"560","Since then I may be a follow-up question if we don't know prior.","NULL"
"147","So I think maybe, yeah, maybe it will make sense to sort of come up with the generalized, um, set of texts.","A"
"54","Yeah.","NULL"
"309","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"359","Or, or explain why you don't like it.","NULL"
"455","We have to group them, but we have to create a single empathy or wait sheet for each question report.","NULL"
"144","Well, I think that the more we can generalize the better, right?","A"
"94","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"105","I'm not really sure here.","NULL"
"314","Okay.","NULL"
"204","But you would not assign to specific project managers or would you?","NULL"
"107","Do you think this will be a big problem in terms of, um, um, technique, you know, programming?","NULL"
"552","No, it's okay, I'm listening.","NULL"
"98","Depends on what they should be able to do.","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","F"
"395","I was probably just thinking this for myself, but yeah, that's good that it, that you, yeah.","NULL"
"263","Because this is already really, it was just a really idea actually.","NULL"
"450","Let's say a survey can only contain so many questions.","A"
"377","I mean, now I really liked that here with the swipe question, I, I wrote this down and also to comment the ability of questions.","NULL"
"170","If, if you're talking about, we simply send an email, I mean, you could just, um, specify a list of emails and that's fine.","F"
"550","Yeah, yes.","NULL"
"478","I probably forgot to pinpoint this in the project description, but this tool we're creating here, it, this should be like a easy, short thing.","NULL"
"116","I think it's really important that we come up with a neat design where let's say a project manager, he can feel there and he can also customize his, um, dashboard.","F"
"407","Just like maybe all the open text questions are grouped together in the report and all other types of questions are also grouped together,","A"
"193","Yeah.","NULL"
"493","I like this idea.","NULL"
"328","Well maybe, maybe we could include them in the, you know, at the end of the survey, a report is created out of this survey, which lists the results of the different questions, right?","F"
"276","Yeah, I like that.","NULL"
"622","So I show it, just clarify some, some more things that might be unclear for you, because from my side, I'm quite happy with our outcome of this meeting.","NULL"
"33","You'd have to tap into this a bit.","NULL"
"379","Wait, wait, wait.","NULL"
"354","So let's somehow include in the next survey.","NULL"
"271","Exactly.","NULL"
"333","Um, maybe we could do it that way.","NULL"
"662","Okay, all right.","NULL"
"405","And for all the questions we can have all the types, but all in all, I would say for the, um, usability or visibility of the results, it would be good to, to group the question types together.","F"
"217","Yeah, I mean that, there are a lot of unclear, um, topics still.","NULL"
"437","Maybe a little cough.","NULL"
"297","Um, I think just for the technical side, it should, of course be possible, but I'm not sure about budget or time scope.","NULL"
"286","You know, like I would really like it if you have something like they have on Reddit or somewhere like where you could maybe also as a, you somehow have to involve the users into the survey.","F"
"458","One of the survey, we will get its own way too in the report.","NULL"
"337","It's like the manager then will be like a first filter that filters out.","F"
"640","So like technically, both would be both will be possible because of the PDF would just be the graphical representation of it.","A"
"448","Well, I think maybe we should, we should limit the service to specific topics, right?","A"
"317","Because it should have some oper download functionality attached with that.","F"
"581","And then for German, you would translate it into one word.","NULL"
"610","Okay.","NULL"
"272","Okay, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"168","That's what I meant.","NULL"
"374","I mean, this is already, you really need degree, the detail work we're doing here.","NULL"
"247","Cool.","NULL"
"51","So like the project manager is the admin of his own business?","F"
"160","So they're just having an account such that, uh, the managers can send them, uh, uh, emails, you know what I mean?","F"
"537","Yeah.","NULL"
"558","We really have to think about this actually, because my wish needs that it's, that the language can be, or the available language to the project have to be set when we, as a super admin, create the project for a customer, right?","F"
"137","Yeah.","NULL"
"597","Yeah, while on the other hand, we cannot expect this from the customer, they pay for something","NULL"
"606","Yeah, I think we have to keep it simple here as well for this project phase one and just go with three languages, German, English, and French and French, and just make sure that at the launch day, these languages are implemented completely.","F"
"530","I like this idea a lot.","NULL"
"438","My friends it's the only rough, but otherwise probably same as me.","NULL"
"510","Because it has to be viewable on different devices.","F"
"641","Whereas let's say a CSV file simply contain the data, which is in the charts, but just let me know if, if there is the requirement to do so.","F"
"269","I think we should add this because, or we should add something like in the end, uh, the questions can be pre viewed again before submitting.","NULL"
"235","Perfect.","NULL"
"413","And now if you propose that they are not, they are not, uh, connected, but they are grouped into their types.","NULL"
"138","This could be quite interesting.","NULL"
"421","Well fine so far.","NULL"
"417","I'm thinking actually, but I, yeah, I haven't really thought about this specific scenario, which is quite an important one.","NULL"
"215","So apart from, from the, from the mailing list, um, which Mark, uh, mentioned, what else is there?","NULL"
"557","So yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"576","But that is exactly the problem, because if we don't know the languages they are going to use, we cannot hard-code anything","A"
"239","And there's the question.","NULL"
"418","Maybe, uh, I mean, I think it's important that we have some sort of, which it for each individual question the report and then, um, hold on.","F"
"393","Yeah right, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"34","Yeah.","NULL"
"252","But, but we would have to, to, to maybe restrict that on the mobile devices.","A"
"221","So, uh, let me just quickly write this down here.","NULL"
"553","I actually have a different question.","NULL"
"56","Okay.","NULL"
"88","Yeah.","NULL"
"153","Because let's say a manager runs the survey, so you will receive the survey in some form and then be able to fill it out.","F"
"483","Not, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"546","That's I think that's that, that would be great.","NULL"
"527","Oh, I see.","NULL"
"604","But I think here it I'm with Chris because if I want to use the tool in my native language, I expect that the tool is, or yeah.","NULL"
"502","I mean, if, if you, if we cook cleanly keep the different clearly keep the different elements and report apart from each other, sort of have different objects of classes.","NULL"
"644","I think they just want to have nice widgets, which they can include in their internal meetings or yeah.","F"
"117","So as to only see, what's really important for him to see at this very moment, but if you want to, can see all.","NULL"
"289","So you mean like in the end of the survey, you can have, uh, some of that somewhat the first question creator and, uh, the, the guys of the survey of the guys that they decided to be off, the roads can agree to this or, or something like that.","F"
"196","So as to assign, um, which team leader can interact with which employees, so where, where does, where do they belong in, in the hierarchy or maybe even from the project manager side, uh, which team leaders belong to this, uh, project manager.","F"
"408","But what if semantically, they don't fit?","NULL"
"596","And then if additional Russian or Japanese or whatever, then probably we have to go with your approach or at least the direction of this approach where we need the customer to.","F"
"615","So keep that in mind too.","NULL"
"573","And what I meant is like the entire GUI, so the, all, all the fixed static texts from menus and that stuff,","F"
"381","Yeah, it definitely has to be configurable because otherwise let's say I, as a manager, create the survey, complaining five questions.","F"
"39","We have really staffs how this payment bottles should work, but it should be a recurring payment model.","F"
"287","They should not just be there in click to questions they should of bringing in their own ideas, which in turns can then be seen by other users.","F"
"325","Maybe we can collect these questions and make us a follow-up survey, which then, or something like that in the end.","F"
"157","Yeah.","NULL"
"69","I mean, do you have the overall idea of the, of the project, right?","NULL"
"70","I don't have to explain what it, what it will do in the end, right?","NULL"
"653","I'm good to, I'm just looking forward to all the notes you took.","NULL"
"496","What do you guys think about, make about creating an adjustable report?","NULL"
"241","At the bottom side is, I don't know, or I don't care.","F"
"524","Which would mean it's maybe on two different platforms.","A"
"430","Okay, I didn't know that.","NULL"
"146","I mean, we ha we, we don't, we have a lot of customers, but it's still quite, um, well, it's, we, we don't serve the whole world.","NULL"
"486","So we can, we can group the question types together, right?","NULL"
"439","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"159","So they have an account, but they never, uh, they never, they don't have access with this account to the, to our tool.","F"
"449","So it's not really getting messy.","NULL"
"366","Yeah.","NULL"
"152","I mean, there, there will also of course be this, the role of the employee or of the servery filler him or herself, right.","F"
"532","Let me know what this,","NULL"
"103","So, um, for a project manager, he should be able to run surveys to all of the business, including all of the employees and stop or didn't managers such as maybe possible team and actress should only be able to create service including their own team and maybe some organic teams, you know how I mean?","F"
"60","Right.","NULL"
"171","We already have that, but two, we actually need to have underlying users.","F"
"302","But not channel it's channel in terms of the survey, let's say a survey is about user satisfaction or umm, employee motivation.","NULL"
"384","Only question three out of five should be commended.","NULL"
"609","And then maybe just keep the possibility in the backlog, but that's certainly not for phase one.","F"
"164","Uh, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"429","Yeah, last week, last Friday.","NULL"
"66","Okay.","NULL"
"561","Oh, well maybe prior what languages there are the, I have the question of where do the translations come from?","NULL"
"12","But I can, yeah.","NULL"
"55","That makes sense.","NULL"
"6","Yeah.","NULL"
"3","Uh, let me just quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"446","So where were we?","NULL"
"375","So I think maybe we should just move on a little bit.","NULL"
"480","But here it's just together a claims like the manager really wants to fill the polls of his team in a specific topic.","NULL"
"654","So maybe if something comes up, there are some unclarities we can talk in the next week for sure.","NULL"
"296","Honestly I cannot say just out of my head, I guess I would have to like do that.","NULL"
"118","Yeah, I think this would be a good approach.","NULL"
"99","Yeah.","NULL"
"10","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"664","Thank you and have a nice day.","NULL"
"229","What kind of, what kind of questions are there?","NULL"
"638","To, to report.","NULL"
"525","How do you mean?","NULL"
"72","Uh, for me, I think it's clear.","NULL"
"516","I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?","F&A"
"396","That we are now found the concepts about this, because this will be a really, really important feature.","NULL"
"466","But normally the questionnaire is already grouped by, by topic, isn't it?","NULL"
"471","This is also a problem with the reports in the end that's they're offering.","NULL"
"531","I mean, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"481","That's also why to be called polls service something, you know?","NULL"
"75","Um, from my side, I think it is mostly clear.","NULL"
"15","So let me quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"397","Otherwise it would get completely out of hand.","NULL"
"121","Maybe we can also add some texts to the, to the, to the surveys for easy filtering or something like that.","F"
"649","Yeah.","NULL"
"612","I mean, that's also, that's quite important for you and your team.","NULL"
"360","And that was the idea for, for the common box, but not for every question.","NULL"
"372","So he can really add new ideas or innovative ideas, or maybe even this way, patients, which then can generally be seen by others and the opera download it.","F"
"534","And if we have time or resources afterwards, in another phase, we can also expand on this.","NULL"
"313","And others have have also this, this option to, to select or comment on.","F"
"5","I mean, you have already seen the email probably about, um, the, this tool we are planning to create, right?","NULL"
"428","It's really tough when","NULL"
"210","Yeah.","NULL"
"278","That's actually a really cool idea, but the answer yeah.","NULL"
"201","We could talk about, I think there should be the possibility to have multiple.","A"
"575","Yeah.","NULL"
"230","What looks fancy?","NULL"
"27","Um, yeah, right.","NULL"
"477","No, it's no offense.","NULL"
"519","And then there is like a neat dashboard or something that he has on his iPad, which is like some starting screen, or I don't know.","F"
"416","Yeah, I can.","NULL"
"319","It's such a comment.","NULL"
"163","I will just get an email?","F"
"20","I think we agreed that we were going to do this on our own, the three of us.","NULL"
"91","That's no problem.","NULL"
"515","I would have to collaborate on this, yeah.","NULL"
"224","I mean, let's say a manager, a manager creates a survey.","NULL"
"599","Depends on how extensive it gets.","NULL"
"420","How's your life going?","NULL"
"593","I mean, I like this, but probably you should, we should just start with the English German French set, because the most of our customers are either one of these.","F"
"21","Uh, this information didn't reach me, but, uh, that's fine with me.","NULL"
"630","So a manager can just decide, well, I want to share this report in form of PDF.","F"
"63","I don't think that should be that much of a problem.","NULL"
"38","So I think we should, it's really important that we also offer such a service and we already discussed this, the board that this should probably something that can be used as a software, as a service where we have customers, they would just sign up to our application, pay a fee.","F"
"498","Yeah.","NULL"
"475","I also didn't.","NULL"
"97","So I don't know how have you got, see, but I think it's quite important that we specify how many abstraction levels of roles we want.","A"
"304","So the manager wants to find out how motivated his team is at this very moment.","F"
"495","That's that's a really good idea.","NULL"
"223","So, um, then we also have to think about the surgery itself.","NULL"
"102","I mean, only the managers are allowed to actually run a survey.","F"
"244","I mean, without touch functionality.","NULL"
"142","Yeah.","NULL"
"209","Yeah.","NULL"
"441","Okay.","NULL"
"108","I think programming wise, it would be the same thing as interest checking for the role and that, that should not be the problem.","NULL"
"555","Yep.","NULL"
"290","Yeah.","NULL"
"292","And these people can then decide if these are good ideas or not.","NULL"
"47","Um, by the way, why super admin?","NULL"
"491","Yes.","NULL"
"132","Yeah.","NULL"
"169","Do we, do we actually have to assign specific users as in, uh, on the platform?","NULL"
"426","Yes, since I got tested positive.","NULL"
"556","I think it would make sense to have a default language for approach check.","F"
"17","Where, where is Tanzil?","NULL"
"1","Let's do it.","NULL"
