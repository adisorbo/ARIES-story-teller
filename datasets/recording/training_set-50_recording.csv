"id","req_specification","class"
"548","I just put this here in the projects goals, you guys see it in the documents I'll share afterwards, but that's that's yeah, that that's, that would be a really important.","NULL"
"176","I mean, actually I really like what Mark said.","NULL"
"16","Where the hell did I put my, um, my notes?","NULL"
"137","Yeah.","NULL"
"440","I thought it was, it was kind of, kind of a joke, but if it weren't for Corona, I would have gone to work without any problems, honestly.","NULL"
"203","Okay.","NULL"
"102","I mean, only the managers are allowed to actually run a survey.","F"
"519","And then there is like a neat dashboard or something that he has on his iPad, which is like some starting screen, or I don't know.","F"
"479","Like otherwise, if someone really wants to create the, in that survey, even use our other services, we have flooded with a lot of them on our home page to create a really full flex drownded survey.","NULL"
"53","If you have a business hierarchy of a bit of, of a specific company, then let's say the top manager board, they will typically, some of them are maybe only one of the top managers will be the project manager of a project because he will sort of manage all the subordinates business units.","F"
"27","Um, yeah, right.","NULL"
"28","So did you receive that, uh, initial project document to which I've sent you?","NULL"
"513","I'm not sure.","NULL"
"256","So on mobile devices, you can only swipe using the touch functionality.","A"
"289","So you mean like in the end of the survey, you can have, uh, some of that somewhat the first question creator and, uh, the, the guys of the survey of the guys that they decided to be off, the roads can agree to this or, or something like that.","F"
"73","There's just some, some small stuff that we need to specify, but, uh, I think that's the reason why we have this meeting in the end.","NULL"
"546","That's I think that's that, that would be great.","NULL"
"628","So maybe to make sense to, to make it available.","F"
"648","Yeah.","NULL"
"260","Yeah.","NULL"
"60","Right.","NULL"
"287","They should not just be there in click to questions they should of bringing in their own ideas, which in turns can then be seen by other users.","F"
"622","So I show it, just clarify some, some more things that might be unclear for you, because from my side, I'm quite happy with our outcome of this meeting.","NULL"
"640","So like technically, both would be both will be possible because of the PDF would just be the graphical representation of it.","A"
"611","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"370","Me, I, as a manager can get feedback in whether people liked and understood the question or not.","F"
"37","But now we want to have a means that our customers can easily and without much effort create service from wherever they are using their mobile device or also their notebook, whatever, you know, it's just currently in all the survey basis, it's like a trend to ease up the process of creating new service.","F"
"573","And what I meant is like the entire GUI, so the, all, all the fixed static texts from menus and that stuff,","F"
"61","Because we really need to think about how, um, to distribute rights in order to, to only show specific information to specific roles.","F"
"32","Exactly.","NULL"
"430","Okay, I didn't know that.","NULL"
"217","Yeah, I mean that, there are a lot of unclear, um, topics still.","NULL"
"321","True, true.","NULL"
"134","Okay.","NULL"
"433","I'm sitting at home all the time","NULL"
"120","And, um, he can filter them.","NULL"
"585","Not, not every user has to specify own Spanish translation to be global.","A"
"484","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"52","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"645","You know, you know?","NULL"
"653","I'm good to, I'm just looking forward to all the notes you took.","NULL"
"198","I mean, just to keep it as simple as possible, I would just say a project manager is always top level.","A"
"358","Right.","NULL"
"325","Maybe we can collect these questions and make us a follow-up survey, which then, or something like that in the end.","F"
"104","Um, so I wonder, I wonder if, if it makes sense that, that a project manager should be able to also see and maybe even be able to add it surveys from managers below him, or should he just exclusively, um, be able to manage his own service?","F"
"328","Well maybe, maybe we could include them in the, you know, at the end of the survey, a report is created out of this survey, which lists the results of the different questions, right?","F"
"633","I get the message for really bad network quality.","NULL"
"449","So it's not really getting messy.","NULL"
"50","It's just, yeah, it's just a word we came up with actually, because as we see it, a costumer has something like an admin, but I probably wouldn't call it admin, but more like maybe project manager, you know.","F"
"393","Yeah right, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"109","Um, I'm, I'm thinking more of a, of a usage issue.","NULL"
"340","I mean, maybe, maybe you would want to say more to explain on why you like, or don't like this, what, what is there out of your mind?","NULL"
"660","So yeah, I think it's, you, you both have a good overview now and you'll hear from me soon.","NULL"
"81","Okay.","NULL"
"353","This idea of user one is nice.","NULL"
"121","Maybe we can also add some texts to the, to the, to the surveys for easy filtering or something like that.","F"
"212","But I think I get you a general concept.","NULL"
"207","Normally you would have like at most, maybe one project manager, which corresponds or communicates with the human resources department of the business and that's about it, right.","NULL"
"79","Yeah.","NULL"
"534","And if we have time or resources afterwards, in another phase, we can also expand on this.","NULL"
"452","So maybe let's say a survey can maximum at the, at the maximum contain 10 questions.","A"
"385","Okay, okay, yep.","NULL"
"369","I mean, I really liked the idea of making questions commendable like that.","NULL"
"588","Then it will be blah, blah, blah, for all future Spanish customers, right?","F"
"316","But I don't really see how this should be working, right.","NULL"
"306","Maybe he asks them what motivates you most at work.","NULL"
"486","So we can, we can group the question types together, right?","NULL"
"511","Then again, customization brings a certain instability to the responsive design, because we can probably not predict how it's going to look.","NULL"
"214","Okay.","NULL"
"279","Bring your others as well.","NULL"
"420","How's your life going?","NULL"
"66","Okay.","NULL"
"233","Um, I cannot hear you both.","NULL"
"239","And there's the question.","NULL"
"654","So maybe if something comes up, there are some unclarities we can talk in the next week for sure.","NULL"
"211","Certainly depends on, on which exact client we're talking about.","NULL"
"201","We could talk about, I think there should be the possibility to have multiple.","A"
"225","Um, we have to think about how this technically should work such a survey, right.","NULL"
"320","I just see one problem, because if I'm the first one to complete the survey, I won't get to see the questions or the bring ups from the other people that take the survey afterwards.","A"
"412","And one is, uh, the scale of satisfaction, something.","NULL"
"108","I think programming wise, it would be the same thing as interest checking for the role and that, that should not be the problem.","NULL"
"124","Um, like, um, the, the content of the survey, so maybe it's about employee happiness or customer satisfaction, and we can use texts.","F"
"375","So I think maybe we should just move on a little bit.","NULL"
"223","So, um, then we also have to think about the surgery itself.","NULL"
"14","Right.","NULL"
"664","Thank you and have a nice day.","NULL"
"230","What looks fancy?","NULL"
"300","Let's say more like a general feedback box.","NULL"
"133","Yeah.","NULL"
"17","Where, where is Tanzil?","NULL"
"615","So keep that in mind too.","NULL"
"331","What Erin, we, in the report, there is a, maybe a dedicated section for a user feedback or user inputs were very conceived for, for which questions, which additional inputs came in.","A"
"251","Yeah, that, that allows us particularly because yeah, it's made me more intuitive for, for P for computer users using a mouse.","A"
"606","Yeah, I think we have to keep it simple here as well for this project phase one and just go with three languages, German, English, and French and French, and just make sure that at the launch day, these languages are implemented completely.","F"
"194","Maybe, maybe the, the language settings, as you said, or maybe he belongs to different business units.","NULL"
"625","Yeah, I think the report should be shareable in some form.","F"
"529","For example,","NULL"
"581","And then for German, you would translate it into one word.","NULL"
"305","So the questions evolve around motivation.","A"
"497","So the manager can move around the elements as he wants so he can sort of create this own sorting.","F"
"658","For sure.","NULL"
"249","Yeah.","NULL"
"156","How do you have any ideas on how we could actually bring the survey to the employees on a most simple way?","NULL"
"461","And then of course, it's, it's the manager who created the survey.","NULL"
"39","We have really staffs how this payment bottles should work, but it should be a recurring payment model.","F"
"392","But, but nice to know that it should have this flag.","F"
"135","Maybe this, this is a good point because maybe we, as a, as a developer of the software could also offer like predefined accents, which I don't know, apply to some sort of best practice or make it increase the usability and also sell these kinds of pack.","NULL"
"602","Maybe they could even add their own translations.","F"
"127","You can select of a certain group.","F"
"506","That what I'm worried about is how, how we are going to represent the state of the overview, as in where, when, how do we define how the report looks, where each widget is placed?","NULL"
"453","And then we should probably group not really group the question and group.","NULL"
"516","I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?","A"
"29","Just, uh, the one that briefly describes our mission about this project.","NULL"
"498","Yeah.","NULL"
"389","If you once built the comment box, you can simply copy paste it from, from your perspective, right?","NULL"
"41","It's like, um, an online application that has different user roles.","F"
"624","I don't know, because for now what we were talking about is that is all online in a widget or somewhere, but maybe, maybe you, he also has to report to someone else and would require it to as a file.","F"
"112","Yeah.","NULL"
"605","That I expect that the tool is a way otherwise it's already ran another tool.","NULL"
"561","Oh, well maybe prior what languages there are the, I have the question of where do the translations come from?","NULL"
"414","Now as a manager, I would have to, to come and take the information from anywhere, right?","NULL"
"263","Because this is already really, it was just a really idea actually.","NULL"
"210","Yeah.","NULL"
"47","Um, by the way, why super admin?","NULL"
"185","Chris makes, makes a lot of sense because of the stuff you mentioned.","NULL"
"204","But you would not assign to specific project managers or would you?","NULL"
"463","I think it's impossible to sort of group the questions by, by meaning of the question for this week.","NULL"
"123","I don't really understand this.","NULL"
"237","So first, uh, I would, I thought about open text questions.","F"
"619","I mean, I think we are at the we're at a very good point.","NULL"
"487","That's actually the exact input I was hoping for, because I mean, technically you, if, if within the same survey you have different topics for some reason, technically you could assign ma as in a group to, to the questions so that it would be possible to, to then in the report group by, by these question groups for, for the results.","NULL"
"284","Yeah.","NULL"
"288","And maybe, I don't know, you know, where.","NULL"
"336","And then he can include this in the followup survey, like Mark mentioned, and in this follow-up survey, the people then get to vote.","F"
"515","I would have to collaborate on this, yeah.","NULL"
"560","Since then I may be a follow-up question if we don't know prior.","NULL"
"115","Maybe Mark, you can get some important because you have probably the best knowledge about user experience.","NULL"
"567","I think that would actually make sense that we keep it like that in this tool as well.","NULL"
"309","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"299","No, not really survey questions and more well let's, let's give me, let's give you a concrete example.","NULL"
"117","So as to only see, what's really important for him to see at this very moment, but if you want to, can see all.","NULL"
"592","That's, that's really important.","NULL"
"458","One of the survey, we will get its own way too in the report.","NULL"
"292","And these people can then decide if these are good ideas or not.","NULL"
"315","So yes, exactly.","NULL"
"235","Perfect.","NULL"
"516","I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?","F"
"298","Just, just to clarify this, this, if I understood this correctly, this is about users pitching new survey questions.","NULL"
"268","Yeah.","NULL"
"623","Maybe just one question, you don't have to necessarily answer it now, but maybe note it down to, to get back to me whether the reports should be exportable, for example, to, to PDF files or anything, or, or CSV.","F"
"258","That makes total sense actually, but yeah.","NULL"
"77","Um, yeah, I think, I think I got, I got most of the parts, so let's, let's start.","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","F"
"220","This is solely the, um, the task of a manager.","A"
"196","So as to assign, um, which team leader can interact with which employees, so where, where does, where do they belong in, in the hierarchy or maybe even from the project manager side, uh, which team leaders belong to this, uh, project manager.","F"
"410","But one is a swipe question.","NULL"
"620","I got a lot of very good feedback from you guys.","NULL"
"485","Like this, it would totally make sense to limit them to 10 and like this, I think there's also only one topic per, per survey.","NULL"
"472","But on the other side, who wants to fill out the questionnaire, which takes roughly 30 minutes?","NULL"
"520","But certainly it makes sense.","NULL"
"538","I think that's, that's a good, a good way.","NULL"
"130","Yeah.","NULL"
"9","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"62","Yeah.","NULL"
"119","So, uh, I think he should be able to see all the, uh, the surveys from the normal metrics by business unit.","F"
"584","But this, the Spanish translation has to be valid for all future Spanish companies that join our software as well, right?","NULL"
"352","Okay.","NULL"
"111","What if he has every survey available?","F"
"162","But just so that I understand you right, so that as a user, I don't really have to, um, log in or anything?","F"
"554","I think in the beginning somewhere you were talking about languages two questions, one to the business side, as in what languages are there is there a default language or how, how do we handle this?","NULL"
"132","Yeah.","NULL"
"114","Maybe, I don't know.","NULL"
"255","Okay.","NULL"
"551","Yeah, please go ahead.","NULL"
"19","No, he is not.","NULL"
"22","Well, it was decided yesterday.","NULL"
"10","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"169","Do we, do we actually have to assign specific users as in, uh, on the platform?","NULL"
"86","By the way you guys can, can you, I hear some really strange noise in the back.","NULL"
"257","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"404","I think maybe for the swipe questions, we can have some, some, uh, a bar graph that shows the sides they swiped to.","F"
"387","Yeah.","NULL"
"69","I mean, do you have the overall idea of the, of the project, right?","NULL"
"153","Because let's say a manager runs the survey, so you will receive the survey in some form and then be able to fill it out.","F"
"442","All right guys.","NULL"
"643","I think PDF is fine for now because otherwise our customers would really be interested in data science of this particular specific surveys, which I highly doubt actually.","F"
"330","Do we have to leave this to the manager?","NULL"
"362","I can say this question should be commented.","F"
"570","I think so, yeah.","NULL"
"238","Like everybody knows them, uh, of course single and multiple choice questions, and maybe we can also add something like swipe questions so that you can have maybe a left-hand side, the right-hand side and a button bottom side.","F"
"71","Or do you have any questions just before we go into detail now, do you guys have any questions overall?","NULL"
"26","Um, so yeah.","NULL"
"565","Yeah, I see.","NULL"
"34","Yeah.","NULL"
"406","What do you think about this?","NULL"
"377","I mean, now I really liked that here with the swipe question, I, I wrote this down and also to comment the ability of questions.","NULL"
"574","I think they have to be hard coded in different languages actually.","A"
"603","Yeah.","NULL"
"122","How, how do you mean text?","NULL"
"462","It's, it's his job to make sense out of this data.","NULL"
"540","This should also be specifically responsive so that all the costumers can fill out the surveys wherever they are.","F"
"149","Anyway, I know that this data, we can go into more detail on this later on.","NULL"
"558","We really have to think about this actually, because my wish needs that it's, that the language can be, or the available language to the project have to be set when we, as a super admin, create the project for a customer, right?","F"
"310","I don't know, the espresso machine motivates me the most at work so I can submit this and then others should see this.","NULL"
"587","So for example, scale question is blah, blah, blah.","NULL"
"425","What about you?","NULL"
"12","But I can, yeah.","NULL"
"283","So, okay.","NULL"
"4","Um, I will, if it's all right with you guys, I will just give you a quick overview, but what has been going so far and I will be needing your inputs on, on, on the specific requirements.","NULL"
"144","Well, I think that the more we can generalize the better, right?","A"
"577","Yeah. But, but if we have to limit the language anyway, I mean, look at our customers, we have to.","A"
"373","Um, yeah, but maybe, maybe I have to think about this more anyways.","NULL"
"15","So let me quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"171","We already have that, but two, we actually need to have underlying users.","F"
"351","And he can select, wow.","NULL"
"272","Okay, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"296","Honestly I cannot say just out of my head, I guess I would have to like do that.","NULL"
"261","Just to finish my thing, sorry.","NULL"
"165","Ah, okay.","NULL"
"302","But not channel it's channel in terms of the survey, let's say a survey is about user satisfaction or umm, employee motivation.","NULL"
"254","Right.","NULL"
"138","This could be quite interesting.","NULL"
"418","Maybe, uh, I mean, I think it's important that we have some sort of, which it for each individual question the report and then, um, hold on.","F"
"427","Oh yeah?","NULL"
"317","Because it should have some oper download functionality attached with that.","F"
"38","So I think we should, it's really important that we also offer such a service and we already discussed this, the board that this should probably something that can be used as a software, as a service where we have customers, they would just sign up to our application, pay a fee.","F"
"78","And if there are questions we'll go with.","NULL"
"93","Maybe it's just simply, can you mute your mic if you're saying something?","NULL"
"301","Exactly.","NULL"
"174","Maybe what's important is, uh, I mean, we have some customers with different which are based in different countries, right.","NULL"
"339","But then, then I would maybe I know how, how from the, from the UX perspective, this goes, but like simple swipe would not be sufficient for this.","NULL"
"226","What kind of question makes sense in it?","NULL"
"641","Whereas let's say a CSV file simply contain the data, which is in the charts, but just let me know if, if there is the requirement to do so.","F"
"371","I think we accidentally here hit another idea, which I didn't want to, to point at, but I think I would just track this down because I really liked the comment ability of questions, but it still doesn't really solve the problem, which I initially mentioned in as in to include the user.","NULL"
"193","Yeah.","NULL"
"471","This is also a problem with the reports in the end that's they're offering.","NULL"
"523","Maybe because you, you need also a good input device, like a keyboard or something, because if you create new employees or new questions, you need to type a bit of text,","F"
"589","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"33","You'd have to tap into this a bit.","NULL"
"543","I think this, this should definitely be responsive.","F"
"402","Um, yeah, I have a small, um, how should I say I thought about this and maybe we talked about the different, uh, types of questions.","NULL"
"276","Yeah, I like that.","NULL"
"13","Yeah.","NULL"
"575","Yeah.","NULL"
"492","I like this idea, yeah.","NULL"
"616","Yeah.","NULL"
"200","Nonetheless, Is there just a single one or are there multiple?","NULL"
"578","No, technically we don't have to, we can hard-code translation, codes, and then simply register translations for these codes.","A"
"290","Yeah.","NULL"
"376","We also need to talk about the reporting specifically.","NULL"
"495","That's that's a really good idea.","NULL"
"380","If the manager allows, so this is also configurable?","NULL"
"270","So like the answers, Hey, that's what you answered to use submit this.","NULL"
"88","Yeah.","NULL"
"96","Like maybe a team miniature or some sort of friend business unit manager.","F"
"85","Maybe we can talk about the naming later on.","NULL"
"559","So we say this project supports English and German and from French.","F"
"579","I don't know what you mean by that.","NULL"
"456","So scale question, one of the reports will get its own, which is fair.","NULL"
"582","For English you would translate it into a different word and maybe someone wants to do Spanish, but they will have to provide a translation for Spanish, but we can simply register this translation.","F"
"35","Cool.","NULL"
"444","I, yeah, I really had to take this phone call.","NULL"
"350","So the manager sees, okay, user one set, blah, blah, blah, user two set blah, blah, blah, nothing more than that.","NULL"
"401","Maybe you guys have some ideas, otherwise I'll give you mine.","NULL"
"139","I'm not going to talk you out of it because you're, you're the business leader on this, but just think about the generalization, if, if it, if it is possible, if it makes sense?","NULL"
"187","Because then we don't have to manage like, see, a thousands and billions of user accounts.","NULL"
"417","I'm thinking actually, but I, yeah, I haven't really thought about this specific scenario, which is quite an important one.","NULL"
"499","From a UX perspective, this will bring a lot of benefits.","NULL"
"647","Okay, I'll note that.","NULL"
"23","Oh yeah, right.","NULL"
"468","Yeah.","NULL"
"364","Yeah.","NULL"
"155","Or how could we, how could we solve this with the survey feeling?","NULL"
"355","That's all, there shouldn't be any, um, post-processing of these ideas.","NULL"
"148","But I mean, I already liked the idea of text.","NULL"
"95","Um, so yeah, like, uh, maybe we, we have this top manager, the project manager, and then typically in the company, we would also have like sub sub-ministries, right.","F"
"365","Well, I can do that.","NULL"
"87","Sounds like a bird.","NULL"
"569","I'm not sure if this is technically doable, actually,","A"
"599","Depends on how extensive it gets.","NULL"
"434","But what about symptoms?","NULL"
"460","Then we have the same for open text question, multiple single choice and so on.","NULL"
"240","And maybe the left side is no, the right is yes.","F"
"304","So the manager wants to find out how motivated his team is at this very moment.","F"
"70","I don't have to explain what it, what it will do in the end, right?","NULL"
"459","And then all the other scale questions are in the same area of the report.","F"
"368","Yeah.","NULL"
"613","Only once you start developing the actual technical parts that this has to be highly scalable in the long run.","A"
"232","I mean, the types of questions I just mentioned there, everyone knows them, but maybe we could come up with something innovative, which will be a unique selling point for our application.","NULL"
"126","Uh, I didn't get to think about this, but probably predefined would be easy to manage.","F"
"473","Exactly.","NULL"
"55","That makes sense.","NULL"
"224","I mean, let's say a manager, a manager creates a survey.","NULL"
"476","I really, yeah, I'm really sorry.","NULL"
"477","No, it's no offense.","NULL"
"252","But, but we would have to, to, to maybe restrict that on the mobile devices.","A"
"178","So, so that the user doesn't have to anything, he will just be added by the manager to this project.","A"
"447","We were, yeah, exactly what the reporting.","NULL"
"246","You can just use the mouse cursor and drag the cart to the, to the area.","A"
"629","I'm sorry, I didn't get that.","NULL"
"634","Okay.","NULL"
"264","Yeah.","NULL"
"333","Um, maybe we could do it that way.","NULL"
