"id","req_specification","class"
"532","Let me know what this,","NULL"
"358","Right.","NULL"
"455","We have to group them, but we have to create a single empathy or wait sheet for each question report.","NULL"
"531","I mean, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"260","Yeah.","NULL"
"99","Yeah.","NULL"
"313","And others have have also this, this option to, to select or comment on.","F"
"1","Let's do it.","NULL"
"245","Yeah.","NULL"
"189","Well, with the user accounts that is actually I think more ideal because then we can actually like pinpoint to specific users and it's not an email floating around somewhere.","NULL"
"613","Only once you start developing the actual technical parts that this has to be highly scalable in the long run.","A"
"44","So this will be asked.","NULL"
"528","So you use it just to make the reporting responsive so you can always view what's happening.","F"
"336","And then he can include this in the followup survey, like Mark mentioned, and in this follow-up survey, the people then get to vote.","F"
"175","So we also have to consider language settings for users. I'm not really sure how we could address this problem.","A"
"4","Um, I will, if it's all right with you guys, I will just give you a quick overview, but what has been going so far and I will be needing your inputs on, on, on the specific requirements.","NULL"
"457","Sorry, scale question.","NULL"
"65","Then on, on the front end side, you can simple check on with which users, uh, you are logged in currently, which roles they have, and then you can simply for each element checked through for which roles it should be displayed.","F"
"90","Should I, uh?","NULL"
"319","It's such a comment.","NULL"
"542","Yeah.","NULL"
"419","There's someone calling me,","NULL"
"112","Yeah.","NULL"
"513","I'm not sure.","NULL"
"83","So, um, typically the company there will be, uh, like our manager, like, uh, some sort of top manager, maybe, I don't know, maybe a project manager will be suitable word.","F"
"325","Maybe we can collect these questions and make us a follow-up survey, which then, or something like that in the end.","F"
"583","And if the user logs in with a Spanish setting, he will get the Spanish translation for it.","F"
"551","Yeah, please go ahead.","NULL"
"166","So the manager will actually create this user and then the user is sort of in the system and will receive the emails on the email address which the managers specified.","F"
"101","Yeah.","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","A"
"421","Well fine so far.","NULL"
"569","I'm not sure if this is technically doable, actually,","A"
"489","So just like to, to Mark different parts of the survey, similar to the tasks, similar to the texts, you, you can create a group and then assign, let's say three questions to this group, but in the entire survey you'll have up to eight questions.","F"
"356","The reason I am saying this is, I'm not sure if, if we make every question, comment, the bolus you guys suggest to","NULL"
"143","Right.","NULL"
"32","Exactly.","NULL"
"585","Not, not every user has to specify own Spanish translation to be global.","A"
"430","Okay, I didn't know that.","NULL"
"303","I'd say it's about employee motivation.","NULL"
"530","I like this idea a lot.","NULL"
"292","And these people can then decide if these are good ideas or not.","NULL"
"630","So a manager can just decide, well, I want to share this report in form of PDF.","F"
"517","On an iPad, I think, yes.","F"
"63","I don't think that should be that much of a problem.","NULL"
"187","Because then we don't have to manage like, see, a thousands and billions of user accounts.","NULL"
"117","So as to only see, what's really important for him to see at this very moment, but if you want to, can see all.","NULL"
"559","So we say this project supports English and German and from French.","F"
"436","Yeah.","NULL"
"35","Cool.","NULL"
"285","I should've mentioned this earlier, sorry, but maybe, maybe less about the, the actual functionality and more about the design will be really nice.","NULL"
"61","Because we really need to think about how, um, to distribute rights in order to, to only show specific information to specific roles.","F"
"213","Yeah.","NULL"
"443","Sorry, I'm back.","NULL"
"79","Yeah.","NULL"
"20","I think we agreed that we were going to do this on our own, the three of us.","NULL"
"439","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"141","Technically it should be possible to do so.","NULL"
"404","I think maybe for the swipe questions, we can have some, some, uh, a bar graph that shows the sides they swiped to.","F"
"422","It's a little early, but I manage.","NULL"
"310","I don't know, the espresso machine motivates me the most at work so I can submit this and then others should see this.","NULL"
"481","That's also why to be called polls service something, you know?","NULL"
"397","Otherwise it would get completely out of hand.","NULL"
"9","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"182","I think Mark, you, you, you have the right track on this.","NULL"
"580","Let's say you have the translation code, which should the books scale.","NULL"
"505","I mean, you're right, because the indie individual widgets or, or whatever this is, then they are modular and we can move them without problem.","NULL"
"402","Um, yeah, I have a small, um, how should I say I thought about this and maybe we talked about the different, uh, types of questions.","NULL"
"479","Like otherwise, if someone really wants to create the, in that survey, even use our other services, we have flooded with a lot of them on our home page to create a really full flex drownded survey.","NULL"
"521","Maybe not the iPhone, but at least the tablets.","F"
"297","Um, I think just for the technical side, it should, of course be possible, but I'm not sure about budget or time scope.","NULL"
"442","All right guys.","NULL"
"663","Cool, guys, thank you so much for your time.","NULL"
"236","Um, yeah, I noted some types of questions here in preparation for this awesome meeting.","NULL"
"618","Yeah.","NULL"
"205","Nah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do this at the initial, at this point of phase one of our project, because I think we should keep it simple.","NULL"
"273","That's, that will be really important there.","NULL"
"186","So from a technical point of view, Janik, it will be probably easiest that way, right?","NULL"
"478","I probably forgot to pinpoint this in the project description, but this tool we're creating here, it, this should be like a easy, short thing.","NULL"
"661","So I'll just stack get all this information in a readable document and I'll provide you with it.","NULL"
"388","That, I mean, the, the, the functionality itself can, is easily reusable.","NULL"
"52","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"622","So I show it, just clarify some, some more things that might be unclear for you, because from my side, I'm quite happy with our outcome of this meeting.","NULL"
"159","So they have an account, but they never, uh, they never, they don't have access with this account to the, to our tool.","F"
"194","Maybe, maybe the, the language settings, as you said, or maybe he belongs to different business units.","NULL"
"299","No, not really survey questions and more well let's, let's give me, let's give you a concrete example.","NULL"
"625","Yeah, I think the report should be shareable in some form.","F"
"341","Is there a, an approach for this?","NULL"
"406","What do you think about this?","NULL"
"286","You know, like I would really like it if you have something like they have on Reddit or somewhere like where you could maybe also as a, you somehow have to involve the users into the survey.","F"
"249","Yeah.","NULL"
"19","No, he is not.","NULL"
"604","But I think here it I'm with Chris because if I want to use the tool in my native language, I expect that the tool is, or yeah.","NULL"
"486","So we can, we can group the question types together, right?","NULL"
"180","And from there on, he will receive mails, but all this language setting stuff, maybe shouldn't concern that the user, I mean, with user, I mean the survey filler, right?","NULL"
"560","Since then I may be a follow-up question if we don't know prior.","NULL"
"458","One of the survey, we will get its own way too in the report.","NULL"
"255","Okay.","NULL"
"390","And then this is a simple flag displayed or not displayed.","F"
"417","I'm thinking actually, but I, yeah, I haven't really thought about this specific scenario, which is quite an important one.","NULL"
"376","We also need to talk about the reporting specifically.","NULL"
"133","Yeah.","NULL"
"383","So I want to configure it.","NULL"
"414","Now as a manager, I would have to, to come and take the information from anywhere, right?","NULL"
"516","I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?","A"
"386","I know you're the technician guy here and you can say if this is doable or not, but if we include the commands and functionality, this should be toggle.","F"
"89","Uh, this, my mother [inaudible], um, she's finished in two minutes.","NULL"
"369","I mean, I really liked the idea of making questions commendable like that.","NULL"
"638","To, to report.","NULL"
"577","Yeah. But, but if we have to limit the language anyway, I mean, look at our customers, we have to.","A"
"629","I'm sorry, I didn't get that.","NULL"
"265","Just a quick input.","NULL"
"476","I really, yeah, I'm really sorry.","NULL"
"561","Oh, well maybe prior what languages there are the, I have the question of where do the translations come from?","NULL"
"304","So the manager wants to find out how motivated his team is at this very moment.","F"
"334","That, yeah, it's just up to the manager, up to the manager to see what came in in this specific survey, right?","NULL"
"74","Yeah.","NULL"
"82","So maybe let's start with the, with the user roles.","F"
"655","I certainly come back to you.","NULL"
"281","But maybe I have, yeah.","NULL"
"54","Yeah.","NULL"
"347","But if you start with open text, then depends on what you want to do, but maybe you have to go up until natural language processing, which can get quite cumbersome.","NULL"
"36","So yeah, I mean that overall wish actually is to extend our, um, services, you know, as for now our costumer mainly, um, fill out service your post or over the, um, portal, which we've set up last year.","NULL"
"62","Yeah.","NULL"
"28","So did you receive that, uh, initial project document to which I've sent you?","NULL"
"30","The word document you mean?","NULL"
"575","Yeah.","NULL"
"497","So the manager can move around the elements as he wants so he can sort of create this own sorting.","F"
"656","Trust me.","NULL"
"344","The question type is it's like an open question texting, but it only serves the purpose for four survey fiddlers to commit their ideas.","NULL"
"191","Uh, I was, as I said, I was just worried about, uh, other other stuff, except from the simple may listing.","NULL"
"662","Okay, all right.","NULL"
"73","There's just some, some small stuff that we need to specify, but, uh, I think that's the reason why we have this meeting in the end.","NULL"
"591","Yeah.","NULL"
"665","Yes, they have to be Recording.","NULL"
"425","What about you?","NULL"
"158","If I can talk here, maybe we could just send them an invite by email, like on the company email or an internal email?","F"
"555","Yep.","NULL"
"241","At the bottom side is, I don't know, or I don't care.","F"
"491","Yes.","NULL"
"18","Isn't he joining the meeting today?","NULL"
"614","So we will be building up in phase two and may possible phase three on the existing framework.","NULL"
"204","But you would not assign to specific project managers or would you?","NULL"
"566","Yeah.","NULL"
"276","Yeah, I like that.","NULL"
"616","Yeah.","NULL"
"619","I mean, I think we are at the we're at a very good point.","NULL"
"246","You can just use the mouse cursor and drag the cart to the, to the area.","A"
"514","Maybe you can grasp this a bit better Janik, but, or maybe also you Mark as a UX specialist,","NULL"
"451","Let's say, I don't know, we have to think about this really detailed afterwards.","NULL"
"233","Um, I cannot hear you both.","NULL"
"617","I mean like a really nice coupling also from the front and backend that allows scalability.","A"
"562","And from previous projects where I think we handled it the way that our client had to provide translations for the languages they wanted, where we just sent them, Hey, there are the terms like the, these these words and sentences.","F"
"67","Yeah, I think so too.","NULL"
"534","And if we have time or resources afterwards, in another phase, we can also expand on this.","NULL"
"282","I think I already mentioned something about the engagement in the project description, which I've sent you, but I think we shouldn't go too much in depth with engagement at this point, because it's way out of scope for this first phase.","NULL"
"223","So, um, then we also have to think about the surgery itself.","NULL"
"17","Where, where is Tanzil?","NULL"
"86","By the way you guys can, can you, I hear some really strange noise in the back.","NULL"
"155","Or how could we, how could we solve this with the survey feeling?","NULL"
"507","Yeah. I would have that I would have to, to also dive in and, and make an estimation for,","NULL"
"527","Oh, I see.","NULL"
"482","So these should be quick, quick and reoccurring service.","NULL"
"258","That makes total sense actually, but yeah.","NULL"
"415","Yeah, totally see this point, maybe Chris, can you elaborate or, okay.","NULL"
"123","I don't really understand this.","NULL"
"637","What format to report?","NULL"
"477","No, it's no offense.","NULL"
"354","So let's somehow include in the next survey.","NULL"
"64","I mean, you, you, you create you in internally, you created a different users with which you can assign some, some specific role.","F"
"261","Just to finish my thing, sorry.","NULL"
"95","Um, so yeah, like, uh, maybe we, we have this top manager, the project manager, and then typically in the company, we would also have like sub sub-ministries, right.","F"
"599","Depends on how extensive it gets.","NULL"
"238","Like everybody knows them, uh, of course single and multiple choice questions, and maybe we can also add something like swipe questions so that you can have maybe a left-hand side, the right-hand side and a button bottom side.","F"
"488","I don't know how much sense this makes, but I think it, it should be possible from a technical aspect.","NULL"
"230","What looks fancy?","NULL"
"602","Maybe they could even add their own translations.","F"
"278","That's actually a really cool idea, but the answer yeah.","NULL"
"24","Sorry.","NULL"
"161","What I want to say.","NULL"
"163","I will just get an email?","F"
"231","Yeah, we need something fancy looking and also something innovative.","A"
"271","Exactly.","NULL"
"543","I think this, this should definitely be responsive.","F"
"435","No, nothing.","NULL"
"636","So what's this, what's this your question?","NULL"
"611","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"188","Yeah.","NULL"
"216","I mean, are there specifics we, we need to discuss or that they're unclear or.","NULL"
"329","So the math, maybe, maybe we put.","NULL"
"300","Let's say more like a general feedback box.","NULL"
"132","Yeah.","NULL"
"427","Oh yeah?","NULL"
"229","What kind of, what kind of questions are there?","NULL"
"2","I know.","NULL"
"525","How do you mean?","NULL"
"15","So let me quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"339","But then, then I would maybe I know how, how from the, from the UX perspective, this goes, but like simple swipe would not be sufficient for this.","NULL"
"209","Yeah.","NULL"
"548","I just put this here in the projects goals, you guys see it in the documents I'll share afterwards, but that's that's yeah, that that's, that would be a really important.","NULL"
"104","Um, so I wonder, I wonder if, if it makes sense that, that a project manager should be able to also see and maybe even be able to add it surveys from managers below him, or should he just exclusively, um, be able to manage his own service?","F"
"420","How's your life going?","NULL"
"16","Where the hell did I put my, um, my notes?","NULL"
"449","So it's not really getting messy.","NULL"
"177","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"316","But I don't really see how this should be working, right.","NULL"
"220","This is solely the, um, the task of a manager.","A"
"116","I think it's really important that we come up with a neat design where let's say a project manager, he can feel there and he can also customize his, um, dashboard.","F"
"320","I just see one problem, because if I'm the first one to complete the survey, I won't get to see the questions or the bring ups from the other people that take the survey afterwards.","A"
"227","I mean, we could probably just stick to our, to our typical survey model where we have scale questions with, with disliking scale and we have open tax questions and we have multiple and single choice questions, right.","F"
"51","So like the project manager is the admin of his own business?","F"
"610","Okay.","NULL"
"485","Like this, it would totally make sense to limit them to 10 and like this, I think there's also only one topic per, per survey.","NULL"
"170","If, if you're talking about, we simply send an email, I mean, you could just, um, specify a list of emails and that's fine.","F"
"242","And then, uh, one can take the, the question that is depicted like a card and can just swipe it to the area wherever you want.","F"
"33","You'd have to tap into this a bit.","NULL"
"144","Well, I think that the more we can generalize the better, right?","A"
"379","Wait, wait, wait.","NULL"
"66","Okay.","NULL"
"434","But what about symptoms?","NULL"
"221","So, uh, let me just quickly write this down here.","NULL"
"91","That's no problem.","NULL"
"256","So on mobile devices, you can only swipe using the touch functionality.","A"
"331","What Erin, we, in the report, there is a, maybe a dedicated section for a user feedback or user inputs were very conceived for, for which questions, which additional inputs came in.","A"
"529","For example,","NULL"
"424","It's always.","NULL"
"314","Okay.","NULL"
"523","Maybe because you, you need also a good input device, like a keyboard or something, because if you create new employees or new questions, you need to type a bit of text,","F"
"484","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"162","But just so that I understand you right, so that as a user, I don't really have to, um, log in or anything?","F"
"269","I think we should add this because, or we should add something like in the end, uh, the questions can be pre viewed again before submitting.","NULL"
"263","Because this is already really, it was just a really idea actually.","NULL"
"127","You can select of a certain group.","F"
"498","Yeah.","NULL"
"199","So every other user and team leader belongs to a project manager.","A"
"620","I got a lot of very good feedback from you guys.","NULL"
"49","No, actually there, there isn't, I mean, super admin.","NULL"
"48","I mean, is there a regular admin?","NULL"
"294","Something like this will be really neat, but I'm not sure if this is way overkill.","NULL"
"516","I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?","F"
"78","And if there are questions we'll go with.","NULL"
"650","I mean, the other thing is also quite interesting, but at this point, I think a bit overkill, I liked the idea, but we also move this really, really in the back of the priority list.","NULL"
"480","But here it's just together a claims like the manager really wants to fill the polls of his team in a specific topic.","NULL"
"471","This is also a problem with the reports in the end that's they're offering.","NULL"
"169","Do we, do we actually have to assign specific users as in, uh, on the platform?","NULL"
"474","This is the point, which I think Mark, you haven't really understood.","NULL"
"157","Yeah.","NULL"
"589","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"360","And that was the idea for, for the common box, but not for every question.","NULL"
"571","But now, well, I would give the admin the possibility to correct the translation at least, but just, just as we clear, we are now talking about two different things.","F"
"640","So like technically, both would be both will be possible because of the PDF would just be the graphical representation of it.","A"
"248","Could we just also like make, make the, the side thingy a button like that you could just, instead of swiping also just click there.","NULL"
"652","Mark, do you have something?","NULL"
"409","I mean, what if let's, let's say you have, um, out of 10 questions in your survey, you have three questions regarding, uh, let's say communication within the team and these three questions they are related.","NULL"
"647","Okay, I'll note that.","NULL"
"226","What kind of question makes sense in it?","NULL"
"626","It may be, I mean, there will be a lot of graphical elements in such a report like charts and yeah.","F"
"361","The comment box in your, this is question specific, right.","NULL"
"437","Maybe a little cough.","NULL"
"198","I mean, just to keep it as simple as possible, I would just say a project manager is always top level.","A"
"601","I mean, if there are just a few terms probably would make sense.","NULL"
"259","Would be nice.","NULL"
"407","Just like maybe all the open text questions are grouped together in the report and all other types of questions are also grouped together,","A"
"266","I mean, I don't know how, you know, the functionality, but sometimes if you just try swiping through and then you realize, Oh, that was the wrong side.","NULL"
"234","I think you're both muted, but maybe, maybe, so maybe Mark, can you hear me now?","NULL"
"212","But I think I get you a general concept.","NULL"
"130","Yeah.","NULL"
"218","I mean, we just talked about those now more or less, but I mean, and, and also now about the communication, so just let me briefly get, um, pinpoint this down.","NULL"
"524","Which would mean it's maybe on two different platforms.","A"
"396","That we are now found the concepts about this, because this will be a really, really important feature.","NULL"
"56","Okay.","NULL"
"472","But on the other side, who wants to fill out the questionnaire, which takes roughly 30 minutes?","NULL"
"70","I don't have to explain what it, what it will do in the end, right?","NULL"
"5","I mean, you have already seen the email probably about, um, the, this tool we are planning to create, right?","NULL"
"80","So yeah, that, that's fine.","NULL"
"136","I mean, this is just one example, but let's sort of sell predefine them project setups to our customers.","F"
"37","But now we want to have a means that our customers can easily and without much effort create service from wherever they are using their mobile device or also their notebook, whatever, you know, it's just currently in all the survey basis, it's like a trend to ease up the process of creating new service.","F"
"135","Maybe this, this is a good point because maybe we, as a, as a developer of the software could also offer like predefined accents, which I don't know, apply to some sort of best practice or make it increase the usability and also sell these kinds of pack.","NULL"
"93","Maybe it's just simply, can you mute your mic if you're saying something?","NULL"
"648","Yeah.","NULL"
"148","But I mean, I already liked the idea of text.","NULL"
"445","This was important.","NULL"
"202","So they are just all on the top level and its like a pool of project managers and the top level and out of this pool, those, the entire structure or hierarchy of the business.","A"
"98","Depends on what they should be able to do.","NULL"
"38","So I think we should, it's really important that we also offer such a service and we already discussed this, the board that this should probably something that can be used as a software, as a service where we have customers, they would just sign up to our application, pay a fee.","F"
"192","Concrete example.","NULL"
"147","So I think maybe, yeah, maybe it will make sense to sort of come up with the generalized, um, set of texts.","A"
"374","I mean, this is already, you really need degree, the detail work we're doing here.","NULL"
"326","But then you get two emails.","NULL"
"499","From a UX perspective, this will bring a lot of benefits.","NULL"
"296","Honestly I cannot say just out of my head, I guess I would have to like do that.","NULL"
"470","And also from a user experience part, and I think the limiting of the questions would not be a good, a good thing because what if you have, for example, 12 questions, so you have to create two different surveys.","NULL"
"646","Yeah, makes sense.","NULL"
"418","Maybe, uh, I mean, I think it's important that we have some sort of, which it for each individual question the report and then, um, hold on.","F"
"257","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"444","I, yeah, I really had to take this phone call.","NULL"
"506","That what I'm worried about is how, how we are going to represent the state of the overview, as in where, when, how do we define how the report looks, where each widget is placed?","NULL"
"416","Yeah, I can.","NULL"
"228","Well, I would pitch put, I would pitch this to the creativity department.","NULL"
"623","Maybe just one question, you don't have to necessarily answer it now, but maybe note it down to, to get back to me whether the reports should be exportable, for example, to, to PDF files or anything, or, or CSV.","F"
"595","So these three languages will be available at the very last launch of the software.","A"
"452","So maybe let's say a survey can maximum at the, at the maximum contain 10 questions.","A"
"96","Like maybe a team miniature or some sort of friend business unit manager.","F"
"586","So once the Spanish has been done.","NULL"
"196","So as to assign, um, which team leader can interact with which employees, so where, where does, where do they belong in, in the hierarchy or maybe even from the project manager side, uh, which team leaders belong to this, uh, project manager.","F"
"59","So, I mean, of course there are like you have to properly already, um, think of how, how we possibly can reflect such a hierarchical, um, role system in a technical way.","F"
"423","Stressful day.","NULL"
"659","We have to reschedule many more meetings also just with you and your team Janik and Mark with, with the designers as well.","NULL"
"181","Like an employee or what do you think?","NULL"
"58","Um, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"42","And depending on your user role, you have different rights.","F"
"13","Yeah.","NULL"
"349","I mean, we could just make it so that these ideas are submitted in raw text and then, or displayed and in the report to the manager.","F"
"111","What if he has every survey available?","F"
"538","I think that's, that's a good, a good way.","NULL"
"251","Yeah, that, that allows us particularly because yeah, it's made me more intuitive for, for P for computer users using a mouse.","A"
"55","That makes sense.","NULL"
"607","So all the elements are there in three different languages and their manager, he can switch the language somewhere on a taco to his liking.","F"
"335","So he, at the end, in the report, he sees all the feedback of the users, but then he himself can decide which of these he liked.","A"
"389","If you once built the comment box, you can simply copy paste it from, from your perspective, right?","NULL"
"362","I can say this question should be commented.","F"
"431","So, so now you're, you're sitting at home enjoying your life or?","NULL"
"600","Yeah.","NULL"
"23","Oh yeah, right.","NULL"
"511","Then again, customization brings a certain instability to the responsive design, because we can probably not predict how it's going to look.","NULL"
"493","I like this idea.","NULL"
"469","Yeah, of course.","NULL"
"295","So technically, I mean, we, we have a timeframe of around six months for this phase one, so I'm not sure if this is all working, maybe only you can.","NULL"
"540","This should also be specifically responsive so that all the costumers can fill out the surveys wherever they are.","F"
"454","Yeah.","NULL"
"441","Okay.","NULL"
"372","So he can really add new ideas or innovative ideas, or maybe even this way, patients, which then can generally be seen by others and the opera download it.","F"
"539","And also in the survey interface, you can fill out the questions.","F"
"603","Yeah.","NULL"
"558","We really have to think about this actually, because my wish needs that it's, that the language can be, or the available language to the project have to be set when we, as a super admin, create the project for a customer, right?","F"
"25","I haven't seen this email.","NULL"
"550","Yeah, yes.","NULL"
"114","Maybe, I don't know.","NULL"
"137","Yeah.","NULL"
"642","And if yes, in which form it should come across.","NULL"
"268","Yeah.","NULL"
"500","I think, I don't know if the programming part will be a lot more complicated.","NULL"
"392","But, but nice to know that it should have this flag.","F"
"495","That's that's a really good idea.","NULL"
"338","The really unnecessary I listen is in his opinion, from the really nice things which he sees worth sharing.","NULL"
"348","No, but I think we sh we wouldn't have to go that far.","NULL"
"574","I think they have to be hard coded in different languages actually.","A"
"366","Yeah.","NULL"
"492","I like this idea, yeah.","NULL"
"107","Do you think this will be a big problem in terms of, um, um, technique, you know, programming?","NULL"
"253","Yeah, no, no, no, not the swipe, but the click, you mean that you accidentally clicked somewhere.","NULL"
"563","Are there, can you translate them?","NULL"
"323","So maybe, yeah.","NULL"
"426","Yes, since I got tested positive.","NULL"
"279","Bring your others as well.","NULL"
"247","Cool.","NULL"
"6","Yeah.","NULL"
"381","Yeah, it definitely has to be configurable because otherwise let's say I, as a manager, create the survey, complaining five questions.","F"
"345","So just keep in mind, open text is evil.","NULL"
"634","Okay.","NULL"
"312","That's a great idea.","NULL"
"490","Yeah, it makes sense.","NULL"
"43","So I think there will be something like managers and maybe something like, um, uh, super admin.","F"
"440","I thought it was, it was kind of, kind of a joke, but if it weren't for Corona, I would have gone to work without any problems, honestly.","NULL"
"126","Uh, I didn't get to think about this, but probably predefined would be easy to manage.","F"
"483","Not, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"174","Maybe what's important is, uh, I mean, we have some customers with different which are based in different countries, right.","NULL"
"597","Yeah, while on the other hand, we cannot expect this from the customer, they pay for something","NULL"
"654","So maybe if something comes up, there are some unclarities we can talk in the next week for sure.","NULL"
"535","Yes.","NULL"
"467","Should be.","NULL"
"463","I think it's impossible to sort of group the questions by, by meaning of the question for this week.","NULL"
"450","Let's say a survey can only contain so many questions.","A"
"605","That I expect that the tool is a way otherwise it's already ran another tool.","NULL"
"612","I mean, that's also, that's quite important for you and your team.","NULL"
"504","It depends on, on how we entirely approach the thing.","NULL"
"105","I'm not really sure here.","NULL"
"518","I mean, think about, think about the manager who's often walking around or visiting different I don't know, departments, and instead of laptops, they have iPads.","NULL"
"215","So apart from, from the, from the mailing list, um, which Mark, uh, mentioned, what else is there?","NULL"
"122","How, how do you mean text?","NULL"
"92","No, no, that's okay.","NULL"
"446","So where were we?","NULL"
"581","And then for German, you would translate it into one word.","NULL"
"176","I mean, actually I really like what Mark said.","NULL"
"639","Yeah.","NULL"
"337","It's like the manager then will be like a first filter that filters out.","F"
"140","But I get your point on that.","NULL"
"118","Yeah, I think this would be a good approach.","NULL"
"10","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"466","But normally the questionnaire is already grouped by, by topic, isn't it?","NULL"
"84","Uh, let me just quickly write this down here as a side note.","NULL"
"631","Can","NULL"
"464","We will have to include really complicated the algorithms, maybe even NLP or something, which should be way out of scope.","NULL"
"88","Yeah.","NULL"
"165","Ah, okay.","NULL"
"125","Would that be a fully customizable tag or predefined texts?","F"
"588","Then it will be blah, blah, blah, for all future Spanish customers, right?","F"
"568","I mean, I was just also the other day I was searching the net and I found DeepL this translation API, and maybe it would also be possible to include some sort of deeper API as in if a manager or now if a user creates an English question, people will automatically translate it to German storing the germ part of this question.","F"
"460","Then we have the same for open text question, multiple single choice and so on.","NULL"
"21","Uh, this information didn't reach me, but, uh, that's fine with me.","NULL"
"94","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"211","Certainly depends on, on which exact client we're talking about.","NULL"
"365","Well, I can do that.","NULL"
"582","For English you would translate it into a different word and maybe someone wants to do Spanish, but they will have to provide a translation for Spanish, but we can simply register this translation.","F"
"653","I'm good to, I'm just looking forward to all the notes you took.","NULL"
"592","That's, that's really important.","NULL"
"503","So it shouldn't be so much of an issue to move these blocks around, right?","NULL"
"309","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"34","Yeah.","NULL"
"342","You can use the Reddit approach again, where you can have comments you can upvote or downvote and then you can.","F"
"305","So the questions evolve around motivation.","A"
"608","Okay.","NULL"
"232","I mean, the types of questions I just mentioned there, everyone knows them, but maybe we could come up with something innovative, which will be a unique selling point for our application.","NULL"
"590","Okay.","NULL"
"400","So I'm not sure here how we should actually display the results of these different questions.","NULL"
"350","So the manager sees, okay, user one set, blah, blah, blah, user two set blah, blah, blah, nothing more than that.","NULL"
"533","I think for the beginning, this would surely be enough.","NULL"
"39","We have really staffs how this payment bottles should work, but it should be a recurring payment model.","F"
"46","Right.","NULL"
"302","But not channel it's channel in terms of the survey, let's say a survey is about user satisfaction or umm, employee motivation.","NULL"
"657","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"644","I think they just want to have nice widgets, which they can include in their internal meetings or yeah.","F"
"332","And then that then remains the question with, with the voting.","A"
"275","Okay.","NULL"
"567","I think that would actually make sense that we keep it like that in this tool as well.","NULL"
"572","One is the interactive part, which should be translated for, for the users between them.","F"
"298","Just, just to clarify this, this, if I understood this correctly, this is about users pitching new survey questions.","NULL"
"237","So first, uh, I would, I thought about open text questions.","F"
"456","So scale question, one of the reports will get its own, which is fair.","NULL"
"222","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"243","How, how would you solve this if someone uses a traditional computer or notebook?","A"
"579","I don't know what you mean by that.","NULL"
"45","I mean, we need some, some, uh, sort of, um, possibility to manage this entire tool.","F"
"146","I mean, we ha we, we don't, we have a lot of customers, but it's still quite, um, well, it's, we, we don't serve the whole world.","NULL"
"627","I mean, other bar plots and so on.","F"
"398","And also the report that results out of survey will be really messed up and bloated with, if every question cook will be commendable, I mean, maybe we can just use this to transition to the reporting system because that's also something which should be like the part of, of course, from an ice service to this, this is really important to, right.","NULL"
"664","Thank you and have a nice day.","NULL"
"385","Okay, okay, yep.","NULL"
"7","So let me just quickly.","NULL"
"448","Well, I think maybe we should, we should limit the service to specific topics, right?","A"
"142","Yeah.","NULL"
"624","I don't know, because for now what we were talking about is that is all online in a widget or somewhere, but maybe, maybe you, he also has to report to someone else and would require it to as a file.","F"
"565","Yeah, I see.","NULL"
"195","So we would need, uh, maybe this part.","NULL"
"508","Yeah, right.","NULL"
"22","Well, it was decided yesterday.","NULL"
"327","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","F"
"277","Yeah.","NULL"
"193","Yeah.","NULL"
"283","So, okay.","NULL"
"564","Would that make sense?","NULL"
"8","Wait, wait.","NULL"
"541","That's also really important.","NULL"
"547","If we could nail this for phase one, actually, yeah.","A"
"120","And, um, he can filter them.","NULL"
"106","Maybe we have to think about this.","NULL"
"71","Or do you have any questions just before we go into detail now, do you guys have any questions overall?","NULL"
"584","But this, the Spanish translation has to be valid for all future Spanish companies that join our software as well, right?","NULL"
"172","I mean, are there additional configuration issues or any other thing that we would require users for?","NULL"
"641","Whereas let's say a CSV file simply contain the data, which is in the charts, but just let me know if, if there is the requirement to do so.","F"
"131","The team leaders or the employees could, could simply select out of these predefined tags.","F"
"393","Yeah right, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"217","Yeah, I mean that, there are a lot of unclear, um, topics still.","NULL"
"240","And maybe the left side is no, the right is yes.","F"
"151","Okay.","NULL"
"119","So, uh, I think he should be able to see all the, uh, the surveys from the normal metrics by business unit.","F"
"340","I mean, maybe, maybe you would want to say more to explain on why you like, or don't like this, what, what is there out of your mind?","NULL"
"621","Maybe we should leave it at that for now because I have another meeting, which I have to attend soon.","NULL"
"76","I mean, this is, as you said, a, a tool for, for survey management or like creation and organization and reporting.","F"
"594","Yeah, I need one of these languages.","NULL"
"658","For sure.","NULL"
"12","But I can, yeah.","NULL"
"208","You don't need a lot of, I mean, we, we talk, um, top level managers of a business here probably to be overkill if, if a business would have more than one managing this, this, this little, um, aspect of the business, right.","NULL"
"128","You're maybe, maybe we can say the project manager can define these texts for his company.","F"
"510","Because it has to be viewable on different devices.","F"
"173","Yeah.","NULL"
"515","I would have to collaborate on this, yeah.","NULL"
"536","I mean, we can choose an approach, which would make the global possibility for responsive design, but maybe just not in detail implemented on each side.","A"
"134","Okay.","NULL"
"203","Okay.","NULL"
"343","Or making maybe, maybe we should just create a new question type.","NULL"
"410","But one is a swipe question.","NULL"
"645","You know, you know?","NULL"
"124","Um, like, um, the, the content of the survey, so maybe it's about employee happiness or customer satisfaction, and we can use texts.","F"
"287","They should not just be there in click to questions they should of bringing in their own ideas, which in turns can then be seen by other users.","F"
"552","No, it's okay, I'm listening.","NULL"
"487","That's actually the exact input I was hoping for, because I mean, technically you, if, if within the same survey you have different topics for some reason, technically you could assign ma as in a group to, to the questions so that it would be possible to, to then in the report group by, by these question groups for, for the results.","NULL"
"41","It's like, um, an online application that has different user roles.","F"
"549","Yeah, so that's","NULL"
"615","So keep that in mind too.","NULL"
"201","We could talk about, I think there should be the possibility to have multiple.","A"
"359","Or, or explain why you don't like it.","NULL"
"394","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"399","Because the manager, they want to be clean, clean, and easy to understand view what's happening within their survey or what are the results.","F"
"307","So the users should have the possibility to bring in their own ideas, should the manager have missed them.","F"
"57","Yeah.","NULL"
"150","I think that's already quite a good input.","NULL"
"321","True, true.","NULL"
"77","Um, yeah, I think, I think I got, I got most of the parts, so let's, let's start.","NULL"
"81","Okay.","NULL"
"100","How much is there to abstract?","NULL"
"324","I don't know.","NULL"
"154","I'm wondering, do you think it is necessary for users to even have like a in or something?","NULL"
"264","Yeah.","NULL"
"544","So we have two elements with which for sure need to be responsive, which is the reporting and survey mask.","F"
"438","My friends it's the only rough, but otherwise probably same as me.","NULL"
"501","I think honestly, I don't know.","NULL"
"412","And one is, uh, the scale of satisfaction, something.","NULL"
"473","Exactly.","NULL"
"461","And then of course, it's, it's the manager who created the survey.","NULL"
"606","Yeah, I think we have to keep it simple here as well for this project phase one and just go with three languages, German, English, and French and French, and just make sure that at the launch day, these languages are implemented completely.","F"
"224","I mean, let's say a manager, a manager creates a survey.","NULL"
"587","So for example, scale question is blah, blah, blah.","NULL"
"468","Yeah.","NULL"
"219","So I would really like it, if an employee doesn't have to do any, it doesn't have to do anything to, to be part of a project.","A"
"573","And what I meant is like the entire GUI, so the, all, all the fixed static texts from menus and that stuff,","F"
"311","And then maybe the teams like, Oh yeah, we all need the espresso machine.","NULL"
"371","I think we accidentally here hit another idea, which I didn't want to, to point at, but I think I would just track this down because I really liked the comment ability of questions, but it still doesn't really solve the problem, which I initially mentioned in as in to include the user.","NULL"
"387","Yeah.","NULL"
"185","Chris makes, makes a lot of sense because of the stuff you mentioned.","NULL"
"333","Um, maybe we could do it that way.","NULL"
"40","So they just sign up in order to use the services and, um, the service as itself.","F"
"453","And then we should probably group not really group the question and group.","NULL"
"262","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"69","I mean, do you have the overall idea of the, of the project, right?","NULL"
"183","Yeah.","NULL"
"578","No, technically we don't have to, we can hard-code translation, codes, and then simply register translations for these codes.","A"
"288","And maybe, I don't know, you know, where.","NULL"
"290","Yeah.","NULL"
"72","Uh, for me, I think it's clear.","NULL"
"368","Yeah.","NULL"
"252","But, but we would have to, to, to maybe restrict that on the mobile devices.","A"
