"id","req_specification","class"
"305","So the questions evolve around motivation.","A"
"548","I just put this here in the projects goals, you guys see it in the documents I'll share afterwards, but that's that's yeah, that that's, that would be a really important.","NULL"
"184","I think that's what you just said.","NULL"
"442","All right guys.","NULL"
"40","So they just sign up in order to use the services and, um, the service as itself.","F"
"452","So maybe let's say a survey can maximum at the, at the maximum contain 10 questions.","A"
"56","Okay.","NULL"
"278","That's actually a really cool idea, but the answer yeah.","NULL"
"463","I think it's impossible to sort of group the questions by, by meaning of the question for this week.","NULL"
"523","Maybe because you, you need also a good input device, like a keyboard or something, because if you create new employees or new questions, you need to type a bit of text,","F"
"365","Well, I can do that.","NULL"
"5","I mean, you have already seen the email probably about, um, the, this tool we are planning to create, right?","NULL"
"585","Not, not every user has to specify own Spanish translation to be global.","A"
"211","Certainly depends on, on which exact client we're talking about.","NULL"
"145","Because we need, I mean, you know, you work now in our business for quite a while, both of you, so, you know, the set of customers you already have.","NULL"
"150","I think that's already quite a good input.","NULL"
"114","Maybe, I don't know.","NULL"
"27","Um, yeah, right.","NULL"
"466","But normally the questionnaire is already grouped by, by topic, isn't it?","NULL"
"247","Cool.","NULL"
"9","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"617","I mean like a really nice coupling also from the front and backend that allows scalability.","A"
"500","I think, I don't know if the programming part will be a lot more complicated.","NULL"
"351","And he can select, wow.","NULL"
"299","No, not really survey questions and more well let's, let's give me, let's give you a concrete example.","NULL"
"201","We could talk about, I think there should be the possibility to have multiple.","A"
"47","Um, by the way, why super admin?","NULL"
"309","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"256","So on mobile devices, you can only swipe using the touch functionality.","A"
"570","I think so, yeah.","NULL"
"337","It's like the manager then will be like a first filter that filters out.","F"
"512","Okay, I see.","NULL"
"163","I will just get an email?","F"
"419","There's someone calling me,","NULL"
"469","Yeah, of course.","NULL"
"623","Maybe just one question, you don't have to necessarily answer it now, but maybe note it down to, to get back to me whether the reports should be exportable, for example, to, to PDF files or anything, or, or CSV.","F"
"259","Would be nice.","NULL"
"192","Concrete example.","NULL"
"645","You know, you know?","NULL"
"426","Yes, since I got tested positive.","NULL"
"384","Only question three out of five should be commended.","NULL"
"8","Wait, wait.","NULL"
"148","But I mean, I already liked the idea of text.","NULL"
"435","No, nothing.","NULL"
"665","Yes, they have to be Recording.","NULL"
"221","So, uh, let me just quickly write this down here.","NULL"
"43","So I think there will be something like managers and maybe something like, um, uh, super admin.","F"
"415","Yeah, totally see this point, maybe Chris, can you elaborate or, okay.","NULL"
"181","Like an employee or what do you think?","NULL"
"217","Yeah, I mean that, there are a lot of unclear, um, topics still.","NULL"
"210","Yeah.","NULL"
"413","And now if you propose that they are not, they are not, uh, connected, but they are grouped into their types.","NULL"
"288","And maybe, I don't know, you know, where.","NULL"
"21","Uh, this information didn't reach me, but, uh, that's fine with me.","NULL"
"50","It's just, yeah, it's just a word we came up with actually, because as we see it, a costumer has something like an admin, but I probably wouldn't call it admin, but more like maybe project manager, you know.","F"
"135","Maybe this, this is a good point because maybe we, as a, as a developer of the software could also offer like predefined accents, which I don't know, apply to some sort of best practice or make it increase the usability and also sell these kinds of pack.","NULL"
"389","If you once built the comment box, you can simply copy paste it from, from your perspective, right?","NULL"
"475","I also didn't.","NULL"
"110","I mean, depending on how big this entire thing gets, maybe he simply has too many surveys to manage and loses track of what is important.","F"
"343","Or making maybe, maybe we should just create a new question type.","NULL"
"601","I mean, if there are just a few terms probably would make sense.","NULL"
"326","But then you get two emails.","NULL"
"53","If you have a business hierarchy of a bit of, of a specific company, then let's say the top manager board, they will typically, some of them are maybe only one of the top managers will be the project manager of a project because he will sort of manage all the subordinates business units.","F"
"421","Well fine so far.","NULL"
"87","Sounds like a bird.","NULL"
"408","But what if semantically, they don't fit?","NULL"
"566","Yeah.","NULL"
"202","So they are just all on the top level and its like a pool of project managers and the top level and out of this pool, those, the entire structure or hierarchy of the business.","A"
"197","And this again would be like a hierarchy that we will have to store and to represent somewhere.","A"
"122","How, how do you mean text?","NULL"
"46","Right.","NULL"
"156","How do you have any ideas on how we could actually bring the survey to the employees on a most simple way?","NULL"
"526","So like the, the actual configuration would probably happen on a, on a desktop or laptop, but for, for the single reporting, if you are in a meeting, you have your iPad with you.","NULL"
"45","I mean, we need some, some, uh, sort of, um, possibility to manage this entire tool.","F"
"274","Hm.","NULL"
"297","Um, I think just for the technical side, it should, of course be possible, but I'm not sure about budget or time scope.","NULL"
"331","What Erin, we, in the report, there is a, maybe a dedicated section for a user feedback or user inputs were very conceived for, for which questions, which additional inputs came in.","A"
"19","No, he is not.","NULL"
"621","Maybe we should leave it at that for now because I have another meeting, which I have to attend soon.","NULL"
"97","So I don't know how have you got, see, but I think it's quite important that we specify how many abstraction levels of roles we want.","A"
"560","Since then I may be a follow-up question if we don't know prior.","NULL"
"58","Um, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"13","Yeah.","NULL"
"616","Yeah.","NULL"
"129","So yeah, that would make sense.","NULL"
"332","And then that then remains the question with, with the voting.","A"
"98","Depends on what they should be able to do.","NULL"
"437","Maybe a little cough.","NULL"
"174","Maybe what's important is, uh, I mean, we have some customers with different which are based in different countries, right.","NULL"
"568","I mean, I was just also the other day I was searching the net and I found DeepL this translation API, and maybe it would also be possible to include some sort of deeper API as in if a manager or now if a user creates an English question, people will automatically translate it to German storing the germ part of this question.","F"
"375","So I think maybe we should just move on a little bit.","NULL"
"527","Oh, I see.","NULL"
"270","So like the answers, Hey, that's what you answered to use submit this.","NULL"
"137","Yeah.","NULL"
"224","I mean, let's say a manager, a manager creates a survey.","NULL"
"52","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"373","Um, yeah, but maybe, maybe I have to think about this more anyways.","NULL"
"506","That what I'm worried about is how, how we are going to represent the state of the overview, as in where, when, how do we define how the report looks, where each widget is placed?","NULL"
"619","I mean, I think we are at the we're at a very good point.","NULL"
"657","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"449","So it's not really getting messy.","NULL"
"584","But this, the Spanish translation has to be valid for all future Spanish companies that join our software as well, right?","NULL"
"263","Because this is already really, it was just a really idea actually.","NULL"
"267","Is there intended to be a functionality to retrieve a card?","F"
"84","Uh, let me just quickly write this down here as a side note.","NULL"
"643","I think PDF is fine for now because otherwise our customers would really be interested in data science of this particular specific surveys, which I highly doubt actually.","F"
"59","So, I mean, of course there are like you have to properly already, um, think of how, how we possibly can reflect such a hierarchical, um, role system in a technical way.","F"
"664","Thank you and have a nice day.","NULL"
"362","I can say this question should be commented.","F"
"513","I'm not sure.","NULL"
"71","Or do you have any questions just before we go into detail now, do you guys have any questions overall?","NULL"
"625","Yeah, I think the report should be shareable in some form.","F"
"127","You can select of a certain group.","F"
"257","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"632","You guys hear me?","NULL"
"157","Yeah.","NULL"
"400","So I'm not sure here how we should actually display the results of these different questions.","NULL"
"492","I like this idea, yeah.","NULL"
"92","No, no, that's okay.","NULL"
"276","Yeah, I like that.","NULL"
"432","Uh, I wouldn't say yeah.","NULL"
"558","We really have to think about this actually, because my wish needs that it's, that the language can be, or the available language to the project have to be set when we, as a super admin, create the project for a customer, right?","F"
"284","Yeah.","NULL"
"613","Only once you start developing the actual technical parts that this has to be highly scalable in the long run.","A"
"486","So we can, we can group the question types together, right?","NULL"
"450","Let's say a survey can only contain so many questions.","A"
"171","We already have that, but two, we actually need to have underlying users.","F"
"105","I'm not really sure here.","NULL"
"239","And there's the question.","NULL"
"633","I get the message for really bad network quality.","NULL"
"430","Okay, I didn't know that.","NULL"
"357","I was not, I was not talking about every question, but for, for the follow-up survey, but for, for, for when you can like, or dislike, uh, other ideas, or maybe you want to add something to it","F"
"198","I mean, just to keep it as simple as possible, I would just say a project manager is always top level.","A"
"285","I should've mentioned this earlier, sorry, but maybe, maybe less about the, the actual functionality and more about the design will be really nice.","NULL"
"260","Yeah.","NULL"
"29","Just, uh, the one that briefly describes our mission about this project.","NULL"
"149","Anyway, I know that this data, we can go into more detail on this later on.","NULL"
"49","No, actually there, there isn't, I mean, super admin.","NULL"
"628","So maybe to make sense to, to make it available.","F"
"54","Yeah.","NULL"
"381","Yeah, it definitely has to be configurable because otherwise let's say I, as a manager, create the survey, complaining five questions.","F"
"30","The word document you mean?","NULL"
"483","Not, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"14","Right.","NULL"
"355","That's all, there shouldn't be any, um, post-processing of these ideas.","NULL"
"501","I think honestly, I don't know.","NULL"
"555","Yep.","NULL"
"493","I like this idea.","NULL"
"189","Well, with the user accounts that is actually I think more ideal because then we can actually like pinpoint to specific users and it's not an email floating around somewhere.","NULL"
"106","Maybe we have to think about this.","NULL"
"142","Yeah.","NULL"
"412","And one is, uh, the scale of satisfaction, something.","NULL"
"547","If we could nail this for phase one, actually, yeah.","A"
"61","Because we really need to think about how, um, to distribute rights in order to, to only show specific information to specific roles.","F"
"141","Technically it should be possible to do so.","NULL"
"68","I think it's more important that we actually talk about the different roles too.","F"
"516","I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?","F&A"
"647","Okay, I'll note that.","NULL"
"111","What if he has every survey available?","F"
"495","That's that's a really good idea.","NULL"
"591","Yeah.","NULL"
"238","Like everybody knows them, uh, of course single and multiple choice questions, and maybe we can also add something like swipe questions so that you can have maybe a left-hand side, the right-hand side and a button bottom side.","F"
"154","I'm wondering, do you think it is necessary for users to even have like a in or something?","NULL"
"73","There's just some, some small stuff that we need to specify, but, uh, I think that's the reason why we have this meeting in the end.","NULL"
"382","So if it's not configurable, so all these five questions can be commendable, right?","NULL"
"22","Well, it was decided yesterday.","NULL"
"203","Okay.","NULL"
"507","Yeah. I would have that I would have to, to also dive in and, and make an estimation for,","NULL"
"383","So I want to configure it.","NULL"
"431","So, so now you're, you're sitting at home enjoying your life or?","NULL"
"380","If the manager allows, so this is also configurable?","NULL"
"158","If I can talk here, maybe we could just send them an invite by email, like on the company email or an internal email?","F"
"609","And then maybe just keep the possibility in the backlog, but that's certainly not for phase one.","F"
"438","My friends it's the only rough, but otherwise probably same as me.","NULL"
"641","Whereas let's say a CSV file simply contain the data, which is in the charts, but just let me know if, if there is the requirement to do so.","F"
"477","No, it's no offense.","NULL"
"95","Um, so yeah, like, uh, maybe we, we have this top manager, the project manager, and then typically in the company, we would also have like sub sub-ministries, right.","F"
"433","I'm sitting at home all the time","NULL"
"403","So some question types are, um, better to be displayed in a specific way.","NULL"
"144","Well, I think that the more we can generalize the better, right?","A"
"646","Yeah, makes sense.","NULL"
"595","So these three languages will be available at the very last launch of the software.","A"
"518","I mean, think about, think about the manager who's often walking around or visiting different I don't know, departments, and instead of laptops, they have iPads.","NULL"
"23","Oh yeah, right.","NULL"
"78","And if there are questions we'll go with.","NULL"
"336","And then he can include this in the followup survey, like Mark mentioned, and in this follow-up survey, the people then get to vote.","F"
"69","I mean, do you have the overall idea of the, of the project, right?","NULL"
"153","Because let's say a manager runs the survey, so you will receive the survey in some form and then be able to fill it out.","F"
"387","Yeah.","NULL"
"103","So, um, for a project manager, he should be able to run surveys to all of the business, including all of the employees and stop or didn't managers such as maybe possible team and actress should only be able to create service including their own team and maybe some organic teams, you know how I mean?","F"
"474","This is the point, which I think Mark, you haven't really understood.","NULL"
"427","Oh yeah?","NULL"
"386","I know you're the technician guy here and you can say if this is doable or not, but if we include the commands and functionality, this should be toggle.","F"
"535","Yes.","NULL"
"191","Uh, I was, as I said, I was just worried about, uh, other other stuff, except from the simple may listing.","NULL"
"582","For English you would translate it into a different word and maybe someone wants to do Spanish, but they will have to provide a translation for Spanish, but we can simply register this translation.","F"
"36","So yeah, I mean that overall wish actually is to extend our, um, services, you know, as for now our costumer mainly, um, fill out service your post or over the, um, portal, which we've set up last year.","NULL"
"354","So let's somehow include in the next survey.","NULL"
"244","I mean, without touch functionality.","NULL"
"133","Yeah.","NULL"
"644","I think they just want to have nice widgets, which they can include in their internal meetings or yeah.","F"
"291","Um, yeah, I'm not sure we somehow have to include that the ideas of, of the survey fillers and then these ideas can sort of be displayed to all the other people that are part of the survey.","A"
"629","I'm sorry, I didn't get that.","NULL"
"561","Oh, well maybe prior what languages there are the, I have the question of where do the translations come from?","NULL"
"467","Should be.","NULL"
"307","So the users should have the possibility to bring in their own ideas, should the manager have missed them.","F"
"368","Yeah.","NULL"
"361","The comment box in your, this is question specific, right.","NULL"
"458","One of the survey, we will get its own way too in the report.","NULL"
"80","So yeah, that, that's fine.","NULL"
"328","Well maybe, maybe we could include them in the, you know, at the end of the survey, a report is created out of this survey, which lists the results of the different questions, right?","F"
"234","I think you're both muted, but maybe, maybe, so maybe Mark, can you hear me now?","NULL"
"91","That's no problem.","NULL"
"359","Or, or explain why you don't like it.","NULL"
"245","Yeah.","NULL"
"342","You can use the Reddit approach again, where you can have comments you can upvote or downvote and then you can.","F"
"531","I mean, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"418","Maybe, uh, I mean, I think it's important that we have some sort of, which it for each individual question the report and then, um, hold on.","F"
"237","So first, uh, I would, I thought about open text questions.","F"
"65","Then on, on the front end side, you can simple check on with which users, uh, you are logged in currently, which roles they have, and then you can simply for each element checked through for which roles it should be displayed.","F"
"318","I I'm, I'm not technical enough to see if this is even yeah, if this makes sense.","NULL"
"444","I, yeah, I really had to take this phone call.","NULL"
"316","But I don't really see how this should be working, right.","NULL"
"117","So as to only see, what's really important for him to see at this very moment, but if you want to, can see all.","NULL"
"116","I think it's really important that we come up with a neat design where let's say a project manager, he can feel there and he can also customize his, um, dashboard.","F"
"376","We also need to talk about the reporting specifically.","NULL"
"75","Um, from my side, I think it is mostly clear.","NULL"
"131","The team leaders or the employees could, could simply select out of these predefined tags.","F"
"212","But I think I get you a general concept.","NULL"
"88","Yeah.","NULL"
"242","And then, uh, one can take the, the question that is depicted like a card and can just swipe it to the area wherever you want.","F"
"124","Um, like, um, the, the content of the survey, so maybe it's about employee happiness or customer satisfaction, and we can use texts.","F"
"404","I think maybe for the swipe questions, we can have some, some, uh, a bar graph that shows the sides they swiped to.","F"
"155","Or how could we, how could we solve this with the survey feeling?","NULL"
"519","And then there is like a neat dashboard or something that he has on his iPad, which is like some starting screen, or I don't know.","F"
"441","Okay.","NULL"
"604","But I think here it I'm with Chris because if I want to use the tool in my native language, I expect that the tool is, or yeah.","NULL"
"539","And also in the survey interface, you can fill out the questions.","F"
"589","Yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"226","What kind of question makes sense in it?","NULL"
"635","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"51","So like the project manager is the admin of his own business?","F"
"178","So, so that the user doesn't have to anything, he will just be added by the manager to this project.","A"
"295","So technically, I mean, we, we have a timeframe of around six months for this phase one, so I'm not sure if this is all working, maybe only you can.","NULL"
"235","Perfect.","NULL"
"398","And also the report that results out of survey will be really messed up and bloated with, if every question cook will be commendable, I mean, maybe we can just use this to transition to the reporting system because that's also something which should be like the part of, of course, from an ice service to this, this is really important to, right.","NULL"
"528","So you use it just to make the reporting responsive so you can always view what's happening.","F"
"402","Um, yeah, I have a small, um, how should I say I thought about this and maybe we talked about the different, uh, types of questions.","NULL"
"248","Could we just also like make, make the, the side thingy a button like that you could just, instead of swiping also just click there.","NULL"
"34","Yeah.","NULL"
"599","Depends on how extensive it gets.","NULL"
"35","Cool.","NULL"
"251","Yeah, that, that allows us particularly because yeah, it's made me more intuitive for, for P for computer users using a mouse.","A"
"459","And then all the other scale questions are in the same area of the report.","F"
"567","I think that would actually make sense that we keep it like that in this tool as well.","NULL"
"136","I mean, this is just one example, but let's sort of sell predefine them project setups to our customers.","F"
"3","Uh, let me just quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"44","So this will be asked.","NULL"
"487","That's actually the exact input I was hoping for, because I mean, technically you, if, if within the same survey you have different topics for some reason, technically you could assign ma as in a group to, to the questions so that it would be possible to, to then in the report group by, by these question groups for, for the results.","NULL"
"596","And then if additional Russian or Japanese or whatever, then probably we have to go with your approach or at least the direction of this approach where we need the customer to.","F"
"521","Maybe not the iPhone, but at least the tablets.","F"
"216","I mean, are there specifics we, we need to discuss or that they're unclear or.","NULL"
"277","Yeah.","NULL"
"511","Then again, customization brings a certain instability to the responsive design, because we can probably not predict how it's going to look.","NULL"
"394","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"652","Mark, do you have something?","NULL"
"269","I think we should add this because, or we should add something like in the end, uh, the questions can be pre viewed again before submitting.","NULL"
"401","Maybe you guys have some ideas, otherwise I'll give you mine.","NULL"
"250","Okay.","NULL"
"363","So the comment will be on this question specifically.","NULL"
"67","Yeah, I think so too.","NULL"
"341","Is there a, an approach for this?","NULL"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","F"
"344","The question type is it's like an open question texting, but it only serves the purpose for four survey fiddlers to commit their ideas.","NULL"
"200","Nonetheless, Is there just a single one or are there multiple?","NULL"
"524","Which would mean it's maybe on two different platforms.","A"
"367","Okay.","NULL"
"563","Are there, can you translate them?","NULL"
"206","I mean, what, what are the odds that, that accompany assigned smokable project managers to such a survey tool anyways, right.","NULL"
"639","Yeah.","NULL"
"74","Yeah.","NULL"
"655","I certainly come back to you.","NULL"
"503","So it shouldn't be so much of an issue to move these blocks around, right?","NULL"
"471","This is also a problem with the reports in the end that's they're offering.","NULL"
"554","I think in the beginning somewhere you were talking about languages two questions, one to the business side, as in what languages are there is there a default language or how, how do we handle this?","NULL"
"321","True, true.","NULL"
"352","Okay.","NULL"
"358","Right.","NULL"
"255","Okay.","NULL"
"214","Okay.","NULL"
"4","Um, I will, if it's all right with you guys, I will just give you a quick overview, but what has been going so far and I will be needing your inputs on, on, on the specific requirements.","NULL"
"484","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"294","Something like this will be really neat, but I'm not sure if this is way overkill.","NULL"
"606","Yeah, I think we have to keep it simple here as well for this project phase one and just go with three languages, German, English, and French and French, and just make sure that at the launch day, these languages are implemented completely.","F"
"143","Right.","NULL"
"315","So yes, exactly.","NULL"
"529","For example,","NULL"
"429","Yeah, last week, last Friday.","NULL"
"138","This could be quite interesting.","NULL"
"292","And these people can then decide if these are good ideas or not.","NULL"
"287","They should not just be there in click to questions they should of bringing in their own ideas, which in turns can then be seen by other users.","F"
"439","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"407","Just like maybe all the open text questions are grouped together in the report and all other types of questions are also grouped together,","A"
"658","For sure.","NULL"
"611","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
