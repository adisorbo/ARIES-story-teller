"id","req_specification","class"
"447","We were, yeah, exactly what the reporting.","NULL"
"160","So they're just having an account such that, uh, the managers can send them, uh, uh, emails, you know what I mean?","F"
"496","What do you guys think about, make about creating an adjustable report?","NULL"
"50","It's just, yeah, it's just a word we came up with actually, because as we see it, a costumer has something like an admin, but I probably wouldn't call it admin, but more like maybe project manager, you know.","F"
"635","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"102","I mean, only the managers are allowed to actually run a survey.","F"
"352","Okay.","NULL"
"512","Okay, I see.","NULL"
"31","Yeah.","NULL"
"433","I'm sitting at home all the time","NULL"
"432","Uh, I wouldn't say yeah.","NULL"
"522","I have, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"643","I think PDF is fine for now because otherwise our customers would really be interested in data science of this particular specific surveys, which I highly doubt actually.","F"
"308","So maybe me as a user can just submit that.","F"
"254","Right.","NULL"
"353","This idea of user one is nice.","NULL"
"153","Because let's say a manager runs the survey, so you will receive the survey in some form and then be able to fill it out.","F"
"318","I I'm, I'm not technical enough to see if this is even yeah, if this makes sense.","NULL"
"197","And this again would be like a hierarchy that we will have to store and to represent somewhere.","A"
"628","So maybe to make sense to, to make it available.","F"
"556","I think it would make sense to have a default language for approach check.","F"
"214","Okay.","NULL"
"200","Nonetheless, Is there just a single one or are there multiple?","NULL"
"152","I mean, there, there will also of course be this, the role of the employee or of the servery filler him or herself, right.","F"
"364","Yeah.","NULL"
"351","And he can select, wow.","NULL"
"375","So I think maybe we should just move on a little bit.","NULL"
"190","So I think, I think, but what Mark was trying to say is that the, the, the simplicity of simply getting an email for the employee, that should be fine because, uh, if, if the project manager or the team leader simply specifies which users to tag in this, um, in this survey and say, or she's simply addressed by their email, that is fine.","F"
"284","Yeah.","NULL"
"68","I think it's more important that we actually talk about the different roles too.","F"
"289","So you mean like in the end of the survey, you can have, uh, some of that somewhat the first question creator and, uh, the, the guys of the survey of the guys that they decided to be off, the roads can agree to this or, or something like that.","F"
"377","I mean, now I really liked that here with the swipe question, I, I wrote this down and also to comment the ability of questions.","NULL"
"576","But that is exactly the problem, because if we don't know the languages they are going to use, we cannot hard-code anything","A"
"545","Yeah.","NULL"
"85","Maybe we can talk about the naming later on.","NULL"
"315","So yes, exactly.","NULL"
"593","I mean, I like this, but probably you should, we should just start with the English German French set, because the most of our customers are either one of these.","F"
"403","So some question types are, um, better to be displayed in a specific way.","NULL"
"328","Well maybe, maybe we could include them in the, you know, at the end of the survey, a report is created out of this survey, which lists the results of the different questions, right?","F"
"526","So like the, the actual configuration would probably happen on a, on a desktop or laptop, but for, for the single reporting, if you are in a meeting, you have your iPad with you.","NULL"
"660","So yeah, I think it's, you, you both have a good overview now and you'll hear from me soon.","NULL"
"184","I think that's what you just said.","NULL"
"210","Yeah.","NULL"
"171","We already have that, but two, we actually need to have underlying users.","F"
"168","That's what I meant.","NULL"
"178","So, so that the user doesn't have to anything, he will just be added by the manager to this project.","A"
"413","And now if you propose that they are not, they are not, uh, connected, but they are grouped into their types.","NULL"
"411","One is an, I don't know, open text question.","NULL"
"121","Maybe we can also add some texts to the, to the, to the surveys for easy filtering or something like that.","F"
"465","Yeah, I think you're somewhat right.","NULL"
"346","As in, if you have simple possibilities, then the processing is also simple.","NULL"
"164","Uh, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"3","Uh, let me just quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"179","And as soon as this happened, he sort of maybe gets a email that says Hey, welcome to the, to this, uh, project.","A"
"370","Me, I, as a manager can get feedback in whether people liked and understood the question or not.","F"
"206","I mean, what, what are the odds that, that accompany assigned smokable project managers to such a survey tool anyways, right.","NULL"
"53","If you have a business hierarchy of a bit of, of a specific company, then let's say the top manager board, they will typically, some of them are maybe only one of the top managers will be the project manager of a project because he will sort of manage all the subordinates business units.","F"
"570","I think so, yeah.","NULL"
"546","That's I think that's that, that would be great.","NULL"
"11","Cool.","NULL"
"317","Because it should have some oper download functionality attached with that.","F"
"520","But certainly it makes sense.","NULL"
"14","Right.","NULL"
"244","I mean, without touch functionality.","NULL"
"27","Um, yeah, right.","NULL"
"391","Okay, yeah, okay.","NULL"
"280","It's the scale question, like some engagement questions and like that, uh, they can only be used to measure engagement or engagement related topics.","F"
"380","If the manager allows, so this is also configurable?","NULL"
"509","I mean, that's, that's good that you mentioned the point of, of, of how it actually should look in there because here, we also have to keep in mind that the design of this tool has to be responsive, right.","A"
"26","Um, so yeah.","NULL"
"596","And then if additional Russian or Japanese or whatever, then probably we have to go with your approach or at least the direction of this approach where we need the customer to.","F"
"250","Okay.","NULL"
"330","Do we have to leave this to the manager?","NULL"
"557","So yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"274","Hm.","NULL"
"75","Um, from my side, I think it is mostly clear.","NULL"
"291","Um, yeah, I'm not sure we somehow have to include that the ideas of, of the survey fillers and then these ideas can sort of be displayed to all the other people that are part of the survey.","A"
"378","So people can, if the manager allows command specific questions, which I really liked this skip some sort of inclusion,","F"
"47","Um, by the way, why super admin?","NULL"
"108","I think programming wise, it would be the same thing as interest checking for the role and that, that should not be the problem.","NULL"
"110","I mean, depending on how big this entire thing gets, maybe he simply has too many surveys to manage and loses track of what is important.","F"
"239","And there's the question.","NULL"
"235","Perfect.","NULL"
"60","Right.","NULL"
"87","Sounds like a bird.","NULL"
"156","How do you have any ideas on how we could actually bring the survey to the employees on a most simple way?","NULL"
"651","Yeah, I think I'm good.","NULL"
"475","I also didn't.","NULL"
"609","And then maybe just keep the possibility in the backlog, but that's certainly not for phase one.","F"
"103","So, um, for a project manager, he should be able to run surveys to all of the business, including all of the employees and stop or didn't managers such as maybe possible team and actress should only be able to create service including their own team and maybe some organic teams, you know how I mean?","F"
"322","That's for sure a big problem.","NULL"
"554","I think in the beginning somewhere you were talking about languages two questions, one to the business side, as in what languages are there is there a default language or how, how do we handle this?","NULL"
"138","This could be quite interesting.","NULL"
"428","It's really tough when","NULL"
"29","Just, uh, the one that briefly describes our mission about this project.","NULL"
"462","It's, it's his job to make sense out of this data.","NULL"
"306","Maybe he asks them what motivates you most at work.","NULL"
"149","Anyway, I know that this data, we can go into more detail on this later on.","NULL"
"502","I mean, if, if you, if we cook cleanly keep the different clearly keep the different elements and report apart from each other, sort of have different objects of classes.","NULL"
"429","Yeah, last week, last Friday.","NULL"
"373","Um, yeah, but maybe, maybe I have to think about this more anyways.","NULL"
"145","Because we need, I mean, you know, you work now in our business for quite a while, both of you, so, you know, the set of customers you already have.","NULL"
"115","Maybe Mark, you can get some important because you have probably the best knowledge about user experience.","NULL"
"97","So I don't know how have you got, see, but I think it's quite important that we specify how many abstraction levels of roles we want.","A"
"272","Okay, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"553","I actually have a different question.","NULL"
"357","I was not, I was not talking about every question, but for, for the follow-up survey, but for, for, for when you can like, or dislike, uh, other ideas, or maybe you want to add something to it","F"
"494","That's, that's something I just noted it down, but something we have to keep in mind and go more into that.","NULL"
"384","Only question three out of five should be commended.","NULL"
"267","Is there intended to be a functionality to retrieve a card?","F"
"405","And for all the questions we can have all the types, but all in all, I would say for the, um, usability or visibility of the results, it would be good to, to group the question types together.","F"
"109","Um, I'm, I'm thinking more of a, of a usage issue.","NULL"
"167","Yeah.","NULL"
"537","Yeah.","NULL"
"401","Maybe you guys have some ideas, otherwise I'll give you mine.","NULL"
"367","Okay.","NULL"
"459","And then all the other scale questions are in the same area of the report.","F"
"395","I was probably just thinking this for myself, but yeah, that's good that it, that you, yeah.","NULL"
"363","So the comment will be on this question specifically.","NULL"
"633","I get the message for really bad network quality.","NULL"
"408","But what if semantically, they don't fit?","NULL"
"301","Exactly.","NULL"
"129","So yeah, that would make sense.","NULL"
"207","Normally you would have like at most, maybe one project manager, which corresponds or communicates with the human resources department of the business and that's about it, right.","NULL"
"139","I'm not going to talk you out of it because you're, you're the business leader on this, but just think about the generalization, if, if it, if it is possible, if it makes sense?","NULL"
"225","Um, we have to think about how this technically should work such a survey, right.","NULL"
"113","Right.","NULL"
"382","So if it's not configurable, so all these five questions can be commendable, right?","NULL"
"519","And then there is like a neat dashboard or something that he has on his iPad, which is like some starting screen, or I don't know.","F"
"598","So for sure they don't want to provide additional work in order to be able to use it","NULL"
"270","So like the answers, Hey, that's what you answered to use submit this.","NULL"
"632","You guys hear me?","NULL"
"649","Yeah.","NULL"
"355","That's all, there shouldn't be any, um, post-processing of these ideas.","NULL"
