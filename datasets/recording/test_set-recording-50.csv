"id","req_specification","class"
"637","What format to report?","NULL"
"519","And then there is like a neat dashboard or something that he has on his iPad, which is like some starting screen, or I don't know.","F"
"426","Yes, since I got tested positive.","NULL"
"518","I mean, think about, think about the manager who's often walking around or visiting different I don't know, departments, and instead of laptops, they have iPads.","NULL"
"302","But not channel it's channel in terms of the survey, let's say a survey is about user satisfaction or umm, employee motivation.","NULL"
"609","And then maybe just keep the possibility in the backlog, but that's certainly not for phase one.","F"
"132","Yeah.","NULL"
"493","I like this idea.","NULL"
"87","Sounds like a bird.","NULL"
"478","I probably forgot to pinpoint this in the project description, but this tool we're creating here, it, this should be like a easy, short thing.","NULL"
"496","What do you guys think about, make about creating an adjustable report?","NULL"
"110","I mean, depending on how big this entire thing gets, maybe he simply has too many surveys to manage and loses track of what is important.","F"
"483","Not, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"264","Yeah.","NULL"
"34","Yeah.","NULL"
"476","I really, yeah, I'm really sorry.","NULL"
"472","But on the other side, who wants to fill out the questionnaire, which takes roughly 30 minutes?","NULL"
"530","I like this idea a lot.","NULL"
"398","And also the report that results out of survey will be really messed up and bloated with, if every question cook will be commendable, I mean, maybe we can just use this to transition to the reporting system because that's also something which should be like the part of, of course, from an ice service to this, this is really important to, right.","NULL"
"459","And then all the other scale questions are in the same area of the report.","F"
"100","How much is there to abstract?","NULL"
"91","That's no problem.","NULL"
"650","I mean, the other thing is also quite interesting, but at this point, I think a bit overkill, I liked the idea, but we also move this really, really in the back of the priority list.","NULL"
"422","It's a little early, but I manage.","NULL"
"525","How do you mean?","NULL"
"72","Uh, for me, I think it's clear.","NULL"
"400","So I'm not sure here how we should actually display the results of these different questions.","NULL"
"3","Uh, let me just quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"535","Yes.","NULL"
"37","But now we want to have a means that our customers can easily and without much effort create service from wherever they are using their mobile device or also their notebook, whatever, you know, it's just currently in all the survey basis, it's like a trend to ease up the process of creating new service.","F"
"455","We have to group them, but we have to create a single empathy or wait sheet for each question report.","NULL"
"19","No, he is not.","NULL"
"260","Yeah.","NULL"
"641","Whereas let's say a CSV file simply contain the data, which is in the charts, but just let me know if, if there is the requirement to do so.","F"
"244","I mean, without touch functionality.","NULL"
"467","Should be.","NULL"
"452","So maybe let's say a survey can maximum at the, at the maximum contain 10 questions.","A"
"551","Yeah, please go ahead.","NULL"
"607","So all the elements are there in three different languages and their manager, he can switch the language somewhere on a taco to his liking.","F"
"539","And also in the survey interface, you can fill out the questions.","F"
"159","So they have an account, but they never, uh, they never, they don't have access with this account to the, to our tool.","F"
"239","And there's the question.","NULL"
"145","Because we need, I mean, you know, you work now in our business for quite a while, both of you, so, you know, the set of customers you already have.","NULL"
"445","This was important.","NULL"
"540","This should also be specifically responsive so that all the costumers can fill out the surveys wherever they are.","F"
"624","I don't know, because for now what we were talking about is that is all online in a widget or somewhere, but maybe, maybe you, he also has to report to someone else and would require it to as a file.","F"
"621","Maybe we should leave it at that for now because I have another meeting, which I have to attend soon.","NULL"
"617","I mean like a really nice coupling also from the front and backend that allows scalability.","A"
"280","It's the scale question, like some engagement questions and like that, uh, they can only be used to measure engagement or engagement related topics.","F"
"453","And then we should probably group not really group the question and group.","NULL"
"563","Are there, can you translate them?","NULL"
"313","And others have have also this, this option to, to select or comment on.","F"
"46","Right.","NULL"
"227","I mean, we could probably just stick to our, to our typical survey model where we have scale questions with, with disliking scale and we have open tax questions and we have multiple and single choice questions, right.","F"
"141","Technically it should be possible to do so.","NULL"
"473","Exactly.","NULL"
"463","I think it's impossible to sort of group the questions by, by meaning of the question for this week.","NULL"
"192","Concrete example.","NULL"
"171","We already have that, but two, we actually need to have underlying users.","F"
"567","I think that would actually make sense that we keep it like that in this tool as well.","NULL"
"61","Because we really need to think about how, um, to distribute rights in order to, to only show specific information to specific roles.","F"
"633","I get the message for really bad network quality.","NULL"
"190","So I think, I think, but what Mark was trying to say is that the, the, the simplicity of simply getting an email for the employee, that should be fine because, uh, if, if the project manager or the team leader simply specifies which users to tag in this, um, in this survey and say, or she's simply addressed by their email, that is fine.","F"
"138","This could be quite interesting.","NULL"
"60","Right.","NULL"
"279","Bring your others as well.","NULL"
"178","So, so that the user doesn't have to anything, he will just be added by the manager to this project.","A"
"208","You don't need a lot of, I mean, we, we talk, um, top level managers of a business here probably to be overkill if, if a business would have more than one managing this, this, this little, um, aspect of the business, right.","NULL"
"604","But I think here it I'm with Chris because if I want to use the tool in my native language, I expect that the tool is, or yeah.","NULL"
"318","I I'm, I'm not technical enough to see if this is even yeah, if this makes sense.","NULL"
"32","Exactly.","NULL"
"207","Normally you would have like at most, maybe one project manager, which corresponds or communicates with the human resources department of the business and that's about it, right.","NULL"
"611","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"344","The question type is it's like an open question texting, but it only serves the purpose for four survey fiddlers to commit their ideas.","NULL"
"263","Because this is already really, it was just a really idea actually.","NULL"
"412","And one is, uh, the scale of satisfaction, something.","NULL"
"462","It's, it's his job to make sense out of this data.","NULL"
"241","At the bottom side is, I don't know, or I don't care.","F"
"508","Yeah, right.","NULL"
"119","So, uh, I think he should be able to see all the, uh, the surveys from the normal metrics by business unit.","F"
"59","So, I mean, of course there are like you have to properly already, um, think of how, how we possibly can reflect such a hierarchical, um, role system in a technical way.","F"
"275","Okay.","NULL"
"156","How do you have any ideas on how we could actually bring the survey to the employees on a most simple way?","NULL"
"161","What I want to say.","NULL"
"140","But I get your point on that.","NULL"
"619","I mean, I think we are at the we're at a very good point.","NULL"
"541","That's also really important.","NULL"
"247","Cool.","NULL"
"582","For English you would translate it into a different word and maybe someone wants to do Spanish, but they will have to provide a translation for Spanish, but we can simply register this translation.","F"
"278","That's actually a really cool idea, but the answer yeah.","NULL"
"374","I mean, this is already, you really need degree, the detail work we're doing here.","NULL"
"95","Um, so yeah, like, uh, maybe we, we have this top manager, the project manager, and then typically in the company, we would also have like sub sub-ministries, right.","F"
"54","Yeah.","NULL"
"304","So the manager wants to find out how motivated his team is at this very moment.","F"
"574","I think they have to be hard coded in different languages actually.","A"
"354","So let's somehow include in the next survey.","NULL"
"155","Or how could we, how could we solve this with the survey feeling?","NULL"
"77","Um, yeah, I think, I think I got, I got most of the parts, so let's, let's start.","NULL"
"503","So it shouldn't be so much of an issue to move these blocks around, right?","NULL"
"319","It's such a comment.","NULL"
"270","So like the answers, Hey, that's what you answered to use submit this.","NULL"
"501","I think honestly, I don't know.","NULL"
"385","Okay, okay, yep.","NULL"
"82","So maybe let's start with the, with the user roles.","F"
"569","I'm not sure if this is technically doable, actually,","A"
"421","Well fine so far.","NULL"
"90","Should I, uh?","NULL"
"248","Could we just also like make, make the, the side thingy a button like that you could just, instead of swiping also just click there.","NULL"
"603","Yeah.","NULL"
"309","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"442","All right guys.","NULL"
"359","Or, or explain why you don't like it.","NULL"
"475","I also didn't.","NULL"
"258","That makes total sense actually, but yeah.","NULL"
"377","I mean, now I really liked that here with the swipe question, I, I wrote this down and also to comment the ability of questions.","NULL"
"115","Maybe Mark, you can get some important because you have probably the best knowledge about user experience.","NULL"
"418","Maybe, uh, I mean, I think it's important that we have some sort of, which it for each individual question the report and then, um, hold on.","F"
"357","I was not, I was not talking about every question, but for, for the follow-up survey, but for, for, for when you can like, or dislike, uh, other ideas, or maybe you want to add something to it","F"
"372","So he can really add new ideas or innovative ideas, or maybe even this way, patients, which then can generally be seen by others and the opera download it.","F"
"389","If you once built the comment box, you can simply copy paste it from, from your perspective, right?","NULL"
"382","So if it's not configurable, so all these five questions can be commendable, right?","NULL"
"224","I mean, let's say a manager, a manager creates a survey.","NULL"
"631","Can","NULL"
"414","Now as a manager, I would have to, to come and take the information from anywhere, right?","NULL"
"183","Yeah.","NULL"
"528","So you use it just to make the reporting responsive so you can always view what's happening.","F"
"56","Okay.","NULL"
"481","That's also why to be called polls service something, you know?","NULL"
"39","We have really staffs how this payment bottles should work, but it should be a recurring payment model.","F"
"630","So a manager can just decide, well, I want to share this report in form of PDF.","F"
"350","So the manager sees, okay, user one set, blah, blah, blah, user two set blah, blah, blah, nothing more than that.","NULL"
"592","That's, that's really important.","NULL"
"167","Yeah.","NULL"
"108","I think programming wise, it would be the same thing as interest checking for the role and that, that should not be the problem.","NULL"
"83","So, um, typically the company there will be, uh, like our manager, like, uh, some sort of top manager, maybe, I don't know, maybe a project manager will be suitable word.","F"
"76","I mean, this is, as you said, a, a tool for, for survey management or like creation and organization and reporting.","F"
"657","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"157","Yeah.","NULL"
"63","I don't think that should be that much of a problem.","NULL"
"502","I mean, if, if you, if we cook cleanly keep the different clearly keep the different elements and report apart from each other, sort of have different objects of classes.","NULL"
"376","We also need to talk about the reporting specifically.","NULL"
"65","Then on, on the front end side, you can simple check on with which users, uh, you are logged in currently, which roles they have, and then you can simply for each element checked through for which roles it should be displayed.","F"
"492","I like this idea, yeah.","NULL"
"285","I should've mentioned this earlier, sorry, but maybe, maybe less about the, the actual functionality and more about the design will be really nice.","NULL"
"588","Then it will be blah, blah, blah, for all future Spanish customers, right?","F"
"436","Yeah.","NULL"
"64","I mean, you, you, you create you in internally, you created a different users with which you can assign some, some specific role.","F"
"329","So the math, maybe, maybe we put.","NULL"
"69","I mean, do you have the overall idea of the, of the project, right?","NULL"
"206","I mean, what, what are the odds that, that accompany assigned smokable project managers to such a survey tool anyways, right.","NULL"
"195","So we would need, uh, maybe this part.","NULL"
"218","I mean, we just talked about those now more or less, but I mean, and, and also now about the communication, so just let me briefly get, um, pinpoint this down.","NULL"
"33","You'd have to tap into this a bit.","NULL"
"114","Maybe, I don't know.","NULL"
"281","But maybe I have, yeah.","NULL"
"386","I know you're the technician guy here and you can say if this is doable or not, but if we include the commands and functionality, this should be toggle.","F"
"106","Maybe we have to think about this.","NULL"
"271","Exactly.","NULL"
"232","I mean, the types of questions I just mentioned there, everyone knows them, but maybe we could come up with something innovative, which will be a unique selling point for our application.","NULL"
"413","And now if you propose that they are not, they are not, uh, connected, but they are grouped into their types.","NULL"
"427","Oh yeah?","NULL"
"451","Let's say, I don't know, we have to think about this really detailed afterwards.","NULL"
"124","Um, like, um, the, the content of the survey, so maybe it's about employee happiness or customer satisfaction, and we can use texts.","F"
"489","So just like to, to Mark different parts of the survey, similar to the tasks, similar to the texts, you, you can create a group and then assign, let's say three questions to this group, but in the entire survey you'll have up to eight questions.","F"
"444","I, yeah, I really had to take this phone call.","NULL"
"363","So the comment will be on this question specifically.","NULL"
"605","That I expect that the tool is a way otherwise it's already ran another tool.","NULL"
"10","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"361","The comment box in your, this is question specific, right.","NULL"
"387","Yeah.","NULL"
"601","I mean, if there are just a few terms probably would make sense.","NULL"
"564","Would that make sense?","NULL"
"126","Uh, I didn't get to think about this, but probably predefined would be easy to manage.","F"
"153","Because let's say a manager runs the survey, so you will receive the survey in some form and then be able to fill it out.","F"
"301","Exactly.","NULL"
"524","Which would mean it's maybe on two different platforms.","A"
"55","That makes sense.","NULL"
"665","Yes, they have to be Recording.","NULL"
"547","If we could nail this for phase one, actually, yeah.","A"
"495","That's that's a really good idea.","NULL"
"552","No, it's okay, I'm listening.","NULL"
"28","So did you receive that, uh, initial project document to which I've sent you?","NULL"
"261","Just to finish my thing, sorry.","NULL"
"139","I'm not going to talk you out of it because you're, you're the business leader on this, but just think about the generalization, if, if it, if it is possible, if it makes sense?","NULL"
"307","So the users should have the possibility to bring in their own ideas, should the manager have missed them.","F"
"41","It's like, um, an online application that has different user roles.","F"
"554","I think in the beginning somewhere you were talking about languages two questions, one to the business side, as in what languages are there is there a default language or how, how do we handle this?","NULL"
"471","This is also a problem with the reports in the end that's they're offering.","NULL"
"213","Yeah.","NULL"
"340","I mean, maybe, maybe you would want to say more to explain on why you like, or don't like this, what, what is there out of your mind?","NULL"
"143","Right.","NULL"
"531","I mean, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"296","Honestly I cannot say just out of my head, I guess I would have to like do that.","NULL"
"273","That's, that will be really important there.","NULL"
"449","So it's not really getting messy.","NULL"
"97","So I don't know how have you got, see, but I think it's quite important that we specify how many abstraction levels of roles we want.","A"
"105","I'm not really sure here.","NULL"
"85","Maybe we can talk about the naming later on.","NULL"
"57","Yeah.","NULL"
"74","Yeah.","NULL"
"576","But that is exactly the problem, because if we don't know the languages they are going to use, we cannot hard-code anything","A"
"166","So the manager will actually create this user and then the user is sort of in the system and will receive the emails on the email address which the managers specified.","F"
"327","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"396","That we are now found the concepts about this, because this will be a really, really important feature.","NULL"
"286","You know, like I would really like it if you have something like they have on Reddit or somewhere like where you could maybe also as a, you somehow have to involve the users into the survey.","F"
"335","So he, at the end, in the report, he sees all the feedback of the users, but then he himself can decide which of these he liked.","A"
"254","Right.","NULL"
"392","But, but nice to know that it should have this flag.","F"
"68","I think it's more important that we actually talk about the different roles too.","F"
"430","Okay, I didn't know that.","NULL"
"653","I'm good to, I'm just looking forward to all the notes you took.","NULL"
"308","So maybe me as a user can just submit that.","F"
"197","And this again would be like a hierarchy that we will have to store and to represent somewhere.","A"
"162","But just so that I understand you right, so that as a user, I don't really have to, um, log in or anything?","F"
"154","I'm wondering, do you think it is necessary for users to even have like a in or something?","NULL"
"560","Since then I may be a follow-up question if we don't know prior.","NULL"
"84","Uh, let me just quickly write this down here as a side note.","NULL"
"608","Okay.","NULL"
"562","And from previous projects where I think we handled it the way that our client had to provide translations for the languages they wanted, where we just sent them, Hey, there are the terms like the, these these words and sentences.","F"
"294","Something like this will be really neat, but I'm not sure if this is way overkill.","NULL"
"384","Only question three out of five should be commended.","NULL"
"209","Yeah.","NULL"
"215","So apart from, from the, from the mailing list, um, which Mark, uh, mentioned, what else is there?","NULL"
"163","I will just get an email?","F"
"506","That what I'm worried about is how, how we are going to represent the state of the overview, as in where, when, how do we define how the report looks, where each widget is placed?","NULL"
"30","The word document you mean?","NULL"
"12","But I can, yeah.","NULL"
"236","Um, yeah, I noted some types of questions here in preparation for this awesome meeting.","NULL"
"234","I think you're both muted, but maybe, maybe, so maybe Mark, can you hear me now?","NULL"
"526","So like the, the actual configuration would probably happen on a, on a desktop or laptop, but for, for the single reporting, if you are in a meeting, you have your iPad with you.","NULL"
"233","Um, I cannot hear you both.","NULL"
"515","I would have to collaborate on this, yeah.","NULL"
"333","Um, maybe we could do it that way.","NULL"
"196","So as to assign, um, which team leader can interact with which employees, so where, where does, where do they belong in, in the hierarchy or maybe even from the project manager side, uh, which team leaders belong to this, uh, project manager.","F"
"652","Mark, do you have something?","NULL"
"654","So maybe if something comes up, there are some unclarities we can talk in the next week for sure.","NULL"
"424","It's always.","NULL"
"613","Only once you start developing the actual technical parts that this has to be highly scalable in the long run.","A"
"13","Yeah.","NULL"
"402","Um, yeah, I have a small, um, how should I say I thought about this and maybe we talked about the different, uh, types of questions.","NULL"
"578","No, technically we don't have to, we can hard-code translation, codes, and then simply register translations for these codes.","A"
"79","Yeah.","NULL"
"346","As in, if you have simple possibilities, then the processing is also simple.","NULL"
"50","It's just, yeah, it's just a word we came up with actually, because as we see it, a costumer has something like an admin, but I probably wouldn't call it admin, but more like maybe project manager, you know.","F"
"546","That's I think that's that, that would be great.","NULL"
"152","I mean, there, there will also of course be this, the role of the employee or of the servery filler him or herself, right.","F"
"572","One is the interactive part, which should be translated for, for the users between them.","F"
"660","So yeah, I think it's, you, you both have a good overview now and you'll hear from me soon.","NULL"
"262","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"620","I got a lot of very good feedback from you guys.","NULL"
"465","Yeah, I think you're somewhat right.","NULL"
"99","Yeah.","NULL"
"405","And for all the questions we can have all the types, but all in all, I would say for the, um, usability or visibility of the results, it would be good to, to group the question types together.","F"
"391","Okay, yeah, okay.","NULL"
"203","Okay.","NULL"
"575","Yeah.","NULL"
"298","Just, just to clarify this, this, if I understood this correctly, this is about users pitching new survey questions.","NULL"
"558","We really have to think about this actually, because my wish needs that it's, that the language can be, or the available language to the project have to be set when we, as a super admin, create the project for a customer, right?","F"
"253","Yeah, no, no, no, not the swipe, but the click, you mean that you accidentally clicked somewhere.","NULL"
"477","No, it's no offense.","NULL"
"581","And then for German, you would translate it into one word.","NULL"
"42","And depending on your user role, you have different rights.","F"
"491","Yes.","NULL"
"257","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"267","Is there intended to be a functionality to retrieve a card?","F"
"470","And also from a user experience part, and I think the limiting of the questions would not be a good, a good thing because what if you have, for example, 12 questions, so you have to create two different surveys.","NULL"
"577","Yeah. But, but if we have to limit the language anyway, I mean, look at our customers, we have to.","A"
"149","Anyway, I know that this data, we can go into more detail on this later on.","NULL"
"450","Let's say a survey can only contain so many questions.","A"
"458","One of the survey, we will get its own way too in the report.","NULL"
"616","Yeah.","NULL"
"379","Wait, wait, wait.","NULL"
"148","But I mean, I already liked the idea of text.","NULL"
"288","And maybe, I don't know, you know, where.","NULL"
"170","If, if you're talking about, we simply send an email, I mean, you could just, um, specify a list of emails and that's fine.","F"
"160","So they're just having an account such that, uh, the managers can send them, uh, uh, emails, you know what I mean?","F"
"482","So these should be quick, quick and reoccurring service.","NULL"
"642","And if yes, in which form it should come across.","NULL"
"544","So we have two elements with which for sure need to be responsive, which is the reporting and survey mask.","F"
"423","Stressful day.","NULL"
"51","So like the project manager is the admin of his own business?","F"
"323","So maybe, yeah.","NULL"
"486","So we can, we can group the question types together, right?","NULL"
"92","No, no, that's okay.","NULL"
"645","You know, you know?","NULL"
"507","Yeah. I would have that I would have to, to also dive in and, and make an estimation for,","NULL"
"104","Um, so I wonder, I wonder if, if it makes sense that, that a project manager should be able to also see and maybe even be able to add it surveys from managers below him, or should he just exclusively, um, be able to manage his own service?","F"
"367","Okay.","NULL"
"312","That's a great idea.","NULL"
"71","Or do you have any questions just before we go into detail now, do you guys have any questions overall?","NULL"
"487","That's actually the exact input I was hoping for, because I mean, technically you, if, if within the same survey you have different topics for some reason, technically you could assign ma as in a group to, to the questions so that it would be possible to, to then in the report group by, by these question groups for, for the results.","NULL"
"231","Yeah, we need something fancy looking and also something innovative.","A"
"366","Yeah.","NULL"
"410","But one is a swipe question.","NULL"
"542","Yeah.","NULL"
"383","So I want to configure it.","NULL"
"648","Yeah.","NULL"
"504","It depends on, on how we entirely approach the thing.","NULL"
"303","I'd say it's about employee motivation.","NULL"
"322","That's for sure a big problem.","NULL"
"561","Oh, well maybe prior what languages there are the, I have the question of where do the translations come from?","NULL"
"365","Well, I can do that.","NULL"
"370","Me, I, as a manager can get feedback in whether people liked and understood the question or not.","F"
"520","But certainly it makes sense.","NULL"
"174","Maybe what's important is, uh, I mean, we have some customers with different which are based in different countries, right.","NULL"
"565","Yeah, I see.","NULL"
"300","Let's say more like a general feedback box.","NULL"
"636","So what's this, what's this your question?","NULL"
"555","Yep.","NULL"
"184","I think that's what you just said.","NULL"
"505","I mean, you're right, because the indie individual widgets or, or whatever this is, then they are modular and we can move them without problem.","NULL"
"4","Um, I will, if it's all right with you guys, I will just give you a quick overview, but what has been going so far and I will be needing your inputs on, on, on the specific requirements.","NULL"
"150","I think that's already quite a good input.","NULL"
"590","Okay.","NULL"
"168","That's what I meant.","NULL"

"550","Yeah, yes.","NULL"
"499","From a UX perspective, this will bring a lot of benefits.","NULL"
"230","What looks fancy?","NULL"
"135","Maybe this, this is a good point because maybe we, as a, as a developer of the software could also offer like predefined accents, which I don't know, apply to some sort of best practice or make it increase the usability and also sell these kinds of pack.","NULL"
"516","I just start wondering if it even makes sense that this, their manager platform is responsive, because does it make sense for a manager to manage all his employees create service and stuff on iPhone or iPad?","F&A"
"86","By the way you guys can, can you, I hear some really strange noise in the back.","NULL"
"429","Yeah, last week, last Friday.","NULL"
"597","Yeah, while on the other hand, we cannot expect this from the customer, they pay for something","NULL"
