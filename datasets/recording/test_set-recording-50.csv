"id","req_specification","class"
"32","Exactly.","NULL"
"317","Because it should have some oper download functionality attached with that.","F"
"498","Yeah.","NULL"
"219","So I would really like it, if an employee doesn't have to do any, it doesn't have to do anything to, to be part of a project.","A"
"491","Yes.","NULL"
"64","I mean, you, you, you create you in internally, you created a different users with which you can assign some, some specific role.","F"
"335","So he, at the end, in the report, he sees all the feedback of the users, but then he himself can decide which of these he liked.","A"
"306","Maybe he asks them what motivates you most at work.","NULL"
"41","It's like, um, an online application that has different user roles.","F"
"417","I'm thinking actually, but I, yeah, I haven't really thought about this specific scenario, which is quite an important one.","NULL"
"557","So yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"424","It's always.","NULL"
"572","One is the interactive part, which should be translated for, for the users between them.","F"
"166","So the manager will actually create this user and then the user is sort of in the system and will receive the emails on the email address which the managers specified.","F"
"654","So maybe if something comes up, there are some unclarities we can talk in the next week for sure.","NULL"
"470","And also from a user experience part, and I think the limiting of the questions would not be a good, a good thing because what if you have, for example, 12 questions, so you have to create two different surveys.","NULL"
"264","Yeah.","NULL"
"265","Just a quick input.","NULL"
"16","Where the hell did I put my, um, my notes?","NULL"
"453","And then we should probably group not really group the question and group.","NULL"
"656","Trust me.","NULL"
"544","So we have two elements with which for sure need to be responsive, which is the reporting and survey mask.","F"
"515","I would have to collaborate on this, yeah.","NULL"
"252","But, but we would have to, to, to maybe restrict that on the mobile devices.","A"
"520","But certainly it makes sense.","NULL"
"605","That I expect that the tool is a way otherwise it's already ran another tool.","NULL"
"76","I mean, this is, as you said, a, a tool for, for survey management or like creation and organization and reporting.","F"
"573","And what I meant is like the entire GUI, so the, all, all the fixed static texts from menus and that stuff,","F"
"273","That's, that will be really important there.","NULL"
"20","I think we agreed that we were going to do this on our own, the three of us.","NULL"
"101","Yeah.","NULL"
"15","So let me quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"161","What I want to say.","NULL"
"454","Yeah.","NULL"
"186","So from a technical point of view, Janik, it will be probably easiest that way, right?","NULL"
"313","And others have have also this, this option to, to select or comment on.","F"
"7","So let me just quickly.","NULL"
"603","Yeah.","NULL"
"279","Bring your others as well.","NULL"
"485","Like this, it would totally make sense to limit them to 10 and like this, I think there's also only one topic per, per survey.","NULL"
"630","So a manager can just decide, well, I want to share this report in form of PDF.","F"
"104","Um, so I wonder, I wonder if, if it makes sense that, that a project manager should be able to also see and maybe even be able to add it surveys from managers below him, or should he just exclusively, um, be able to manage his own service?","F"
"140","But I get your point on that.","NULL"
"494","That's, that's something I just noted it down, but something we have to keep in mind and go more into that.","NULL"
"549","Yeah, so that's","NULL"
"569","I'm not sure if this is technically doable, actually,","A"
"126","Uh, I didn't get to think about this, but probably predefined would be easy to manage.","F"
"536","I mean, we can choose an approach, which would make the global possibility for responsive design, but maybe just not in detail implemented on each side.","A"
"446","So where were we?","NULL"
"42","And depending on your user role, you have different rights.","F"
"542","Yeah.","NULL"
"48","I mean, is there a regular admin?","NULL"
"440","I thought it was, it was kind of, kind of a joke, but if it weren't for Corona, I would have gone to work without any problems, honestly.","NULL"
"543","I think this, this should definitely be responsive.","F"
"574","I think they have to be hard coded in different languages actually.","A"
"240","And maybe the left side is no, the right is yes.","F"
"118","Yeah, I think this would be a good approach.","NULL"
"314","Okay.","NULL"
"1","Let's do it.","NULL"
"123","I don't really understand this.","NULL"
"236","Um, yeah, I noted some types of questions here in preparation for this awesome meeting.","NULL"
"82","So maybe let's start with the, with the user roles.","F"
"622","So I show it, just clarify some, some more things that might be unclear for you, because from my side, I'm quite happy with our outcome of this meeting.","NULL"
"588","Then it will be blah, blah, blah, for all future Spanish customers, right?","F"
"462","It's, it's his job to make sense out of this data.","NULL"
"385","Okay, okay, yep.","NULL"
"215","So apart from, from the, from the mailing list, um, which Mark, uh, mentioned, what else is there?","NULL"
"230","What looks fancy?","NULL"
"134","Okay.","NULL"
"461","And then of course, it's, it's the manager who created the survey.","NULL"
"232","I mean, the types of questions I just mentioned there, everyone knows them, but maybe we could come up with something innovative, which will be a unique selling point for our application.","NULL"
"24","Sorry.","NULL"
"209","Yeah.","NULL"
"395","I was probably just thinking this for myself, but yeah, that's good that it, that you, yeah.","NULL"
"258","That makes total sense actually, but yeah.","NULL"
"388","That, I mean, the, the, the functionality itself can, is easily reusable.","NULL"
"334","That, yeah, it's just up to the manager, up to the manager to see what came in in this specific survey, right?","NULL"
"564","Would that make sense?","NULL"
"2","I know.","NULL"
"409","I mean, what if let's, let's say you have, um, out of 10 questions in your survey, you have three questions regarding, uh, let's say communication within the team and these three questions they are related.","NULL"
"514","Maybe you can grasp this a bit better Janik, but, or maybe also you Mark as a UX specialist,","NULL"
"168","That's what I meant.","NULL"
"261","Just to finish my thing, sorry.","NULL"
"369","I mean, I really liked the idea of making questions commendable like that.","NULL"
"620","I got a lot of very good feedback from you guys.","NULL"
"187","Because then we don't have to manage like, see, a thousands and billions of user accounts.","NULL"
"333","Um, maybe we could do it that way.","NULL"
"626","It may be, I mean, there will be a lot of graphical elements in such a report like charts and yeah.","F"
"510","Because it has to be viewable on different devices.","F"
"302","But not channel it's channel in terms of the survey, let's say a survey is about user satisfaction or umm, employee motivation.","NULL"
"165","Ah, okay.","NULL"
"86","By the way you guys can, can you, I hear some really strange noise in the back.","NULL"
"663","Cool, guys, thank you so much for your time.","NULL"
"425","What about you?","NULL"
"139","I'm not going to talk you out of it because you're, you're the business leader on this, but just think about the generalization, if, if it, if it is possible, if it makes sense?","NULL"
"372","So he can really add new ideas or innovative ideas, or maybe even this way, patients, which then can generally be seen by others and the opera download it.","F"
"422","It's a little early, but I manage.","NULL"
"151","Okay.","NULL"
"624","I don't know, because for now what we were talking about is that is all online in a widget or somewhere, but maybe, maybe you, he also has to report to someone else and would require it to as a file.","F"
"420","How's your life going?","NULL"
"346","As in, if you have simple possibilities, then the processing is also simple.","NULL"
"451","Let's say, I don't know, we have to think about this really detailed afterwards.","NULL"
"551","Yeah, please go ahead.","NULL"
"195","So we would need, uh, maybe this part.","NULL"
"25","I haven't seen this email.","NULL"
"319","It's such a comment.","NULL"
"96","Like maybe a team miniature or some sort of friend business unit manager.","F"
"10","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"272","Okay, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"472","But on the other side, who wants to fill out the questionnaire, which takes roughly 30 minutes?","NULL"
"390","And then this is a simple flag displayed or not displayed.","F"
"502","I mean, if, if you, if we cook cleanly keep the different clearly keep the different elements and report apart from each other, sort of have different objects of classes.","NULL"
"607","So all the elements are there in three different languages and their manager, he can switch the language somewhere on a taco to his liking.","F"
"455","We have to group them, but we have to create a single empathy or wait sheet for each question report.","NULL"
"634","Okay.","NULL"
"325","Maybe we can collect these questions and make us a follow-up survey, which then, or something like that in the end.","F"
"445","This was important.","NULL"
"275","Okay.","NULL"
"410","But one is a swipe question.","NULL"
"79","Yeah.","NULL"
"300","Let's say more like a general feedback box.","NULL"
"480","But here it's just together a claims like the manager really wants to fill the polls of his team in a specific topic.","NULL"
"194","Maybe, maybe the, the language settings, as you said, or maybe he belongs to different business units.","NULL"
"532","Let me know what this,","NULL"
"281","But maybe I have, yeah.","NULL"
"460","Then we have the same for open text question, multiple single choice and so on.","NULL"
"164","Uh, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"220","This is solely the, um, the task of a manager.","A"
"115","Maybe Mark, you can get some important because you have probably the best knowledge about user experience.","NULL"
"182","I think Mark, you, you, you have the right track on this.","NULL"
"553","I actually have a different question.","NULL"
"653","I'm good to, I'm just looking forward to all the notes you took.","NULL"
"497","So the manager can move around the elements as he wants so he can sort of create this own sorting.","F"
"193","Yeah.","NULL"
"423","Stressful day.","NULL"
"152","I mean, there, there will also of course be this, the role of the employee or of the servery filler him or herself, right.","F"
"583","And if the user logs in with a Spanish setting, he will get the Spanish translation for it.","F"
"324","I don't know.","NULL"
"392","But, but nice to know that it should have this flag.","F"
"650","I mean, the other thing is also quite interesting, but at this point, I think a bit overkill, I liked the idea, but we also move this really, really in the back of the priority list.","NULL"
"428","It's really tough when","NULL"
"631","Can","NULL"
"636","So what's this, what's this your question?","NULL"
"289","So you mean like in the end of the survey, you can have, uh, some of that somewhat the first question creator and, uh, the, the guys of the survey of the guys that they decided to be off, the roads can agree to this or, or something like that.","F"
"94","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"488","I don't know how much sense this makes, but I think it, it should be possible from a technical aspect.","NULL"
"457","Sorry, scale question.","NULL"
"196","So as to assign, um, which team leader can interact with which employees, so where, where does, where do they belong in, in the hierarchy or maybe even from the project manager side, uh, which team leaders belong to this, uh, project manager.","F"
"180","And from there on, he will receive mails, but all this language setting stuff, maybe shouldn't concern that the user, I mean, with user, I mean the survey filler, right?","NULL"
"17","Where, where is Tanzil?","NULL"
"347","But if you start with open text, then depends on what you want to do, but maybe you have to go up until natural language processing, which can get quite cumbersome.","NULL"
"109","Um, I'm, I'm thinking more of a, of a usage issue.","NULL"
"592","That's, that's really important.","NULL"
"83","So, um, typically the company there will be, uh, like our manager, like, uh, some sort of top manager, maybe, I don't know, maybe a project manager will be suitable word.","F"
"473","Exactly.","NULL"
"57","Yeah.","NULL"
"304","So the manager wants to find out how motivated his team is at this very moment.","F"
"391","Okay, yeah, okay.","NULL"
"167","Yeah.","NULL"
"205","Nah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do this at the initial, at this point of phase one of our project, because I think we should keep it simple.","Null"
"379","Wait, wait, wait.","NULL"
"81","Okay.","NULL"
"249","Yeah.","NULL"
"479","Like otherwise, if someone really wants to create the, in that survey, even use our other services, we have flooded with a lot of them on our home page to create a really full flex drownded survey.","NULL"
"660","So yeah, I think it's, you, you both have a good overview now and you'll hear from me soon.","NULL"
"207","Normally you would have like at most, maybe one project manager, which corresponds or communicates with the human resources department of the business and that's about it, right.","NULL"
"374","I mean, this is already, you really need degree, the detail work we're doing here.","NULL"
"366","Yeah.","NULL"
"12","But I can, yeah.","NULL"
"537","Yeah.","NULL"
"482","So these should be quick, quick and reoccurring service.","NULL"
"540","This should also be specifically responsive so that all the costumers can fill out the surveys wherever they are.","F"
"456","So scale question, one of the reports will get its own, which is fair.","NULL"
"303","I'd say it's about employee motivation.","NULL"
"522","I have, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"223","So, um, then we also have to think about the surgery itself.","NULL"
"530","I like this idea a lot.","NULL"
"241","At the bottom side is, I don't know, or I don't care.","F"
"615","So keep that in mind too.","NULL"
"345","So just keep in mind, open text is evil.","NULL"
"183","Yeah.","NULL"
"204","But you would not assign to specific project managers or would you?","NULL"
"340","I mean, maybe, maybe you would want to say more to explain on why you like, or don't like this, what, what is there out of your mind?","NULL"
"638","To, to report.","NULL"
"60","Right.","NULL"
"496","What do you guys think about, make about creating an adjustable report?","NULL"
"175","So we also have to consider language settings for users. I'm not really sure how we could address this problem.","A"
"562","And from previous projects where I think we handled it the way that our client had to provide translations for the languages they wanted, where we just sent them, Hey, there are the terms like the, these these words and sentences.","F"
"541","That's also really important.","NULL"
"504","It depends on, on how we entirely approach the thing.","NULL"
"349","I mean, we could just make it so that these ideas are submitted in raw text and then, or displayed and in the report to the manager.","F"
"448","Well, I think maybe we should, we should limit the service to specific topics, right?","A"
"396","That we are now found the concepts about this, because this will be a really, really important feature.","NULL"
"90","Should I, uh?","NULL"
"177","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"579","I don't know what you mean by that.","NULL"
"33","You'd have to tap into this a bit.","NULL"
"243","How, how would you solve this if someone uses a traditional computer or notebook?","A"
"356","The reason I am saying this is, I'm not sure if, if we make every question, comment, the bolus you guys suggest to","NULL"
"246","You can just use the mouse cursor and drag the cart to the, to the area.","A"
"125","Would that be a fully customizable tag or predefined texts?","F"
"66","Okay.","NULL"
"339","But then, then I would maybe I know how, how from the, from the UX perspective, this goes, but like simple swipe would not be sufficient for this.","NULL"
"159","So they have an account, but they never, uh, they never, they don't have access with this account to the, to our tool.","F"
"290","Yeah.","NULL"
"262","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"327","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"533","I think for the beginning, this would surely be enough.","NULL"
"608","Okay.","NULL"
"26","Um, so yeah.","NULL"
"128","You're maybe, maybe we can say the project manager can define these texts for his company.","F"
"416","Yeah, I can.","NULL"
"89","Uh, this, my mother [inaudible], um, she's finished in two minutes.","NULL"
"465","Yeah, I think you're somewhat right.","NULL"
"18","Isn't he joining the meeting today?","NULL"
"173","Yeah.","NULL"
"222","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"614","So we will be building up in phase two and may possible phase three on the existing framework.","NULL"
"233","Um, I cannot hear you both.","NULL"
"505","I mean, you're right, because the indie individual widgets or, or whatever this is, then they are modular and we can move them without problem.","NULL"
"640","So like technically, both would be both will be possible because of the PDF would just be the graphical representation of it.","A"
"169","Do we, do we actually have to assign specific users as in, uh, on the platform?","NULL"
"208","You don't need a lot of, I mean, we, we talk, um, top level managers of a business here probably to be overkill if, if a business would have more than one managing this, this, this little, um, aspect of the business, right.","NULL"
"478","I probably forgot to pinpoint this in the project description, but this tool we're creating here, it, this should be like a easy, short thing.","NULL"
"590","Okay.","NULL"
"580","Let's say you have the translation code, which should the books scale.","NULL"
"598","So for sure they don't want to provide additional work in order to be able to use it","NULL"
"253","Yeah, no, no, no, not the swipe, but the click, you mean that you accidentally clicked somewhere.","NULL"
"371","I think we accidentally here hit another idea, which I didn't want to, to point at, but I think I would just track this down because I really liked the comment ability of questions, but it still doesn't really solve the problem, which I initially mentioned in as in to include the user.","NULL"
"121","Maybe we can also add some texts to the, to the, to the surveys for easy filtering or something like that.","F"
"612","I mean, that's also, that's quite important for you and your team.","NULL"
"113","Right.","NULL"
"662","Okay, all right.","NULL"
"637","What format to report?","NULL"
"179","And as soon as this happened, he sort of maybe gets a email that says Hey, welcome to the, to this, uh, project.","A"
"38","So I think we should, it's really important that we also offer such a service and we already discussed this, the board that this should probably something that can be used as a software, as a service where we have customers, they would just sign up to our application, pay a fee.","F"
"577","Yeah. But, but if we have to limit the language anyway, I mean, look at our customers, we have to.","A"
"229","What kind of, what kind of questions are there?","NULL"
"320","I just see one problem, because if I'm the first one to complete the survey, I won't get to see the questions or the bring ups from the other people that take the survey afterwards.","A"
"11","Cool.","NULL"
"378","So people can, if the manager allows command specific questions, which I really liked this skip some sort of inclusion,","F"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","A"
"112","Yeah.","NULL"
"310","I don't know, the espresso machine motivates me the most at work so I can submit this and then others should see this.","NULL"
"283","So, okay.","NULL"
"464","We will have to include really complicated the algorithms, maybe even NLP or something, which should be way out of scope.","NULL"
"213","Yeah.","NULL"
"509","I mean, that's, that's good that you mentioned the point of, of, of how it actually should look in there because here, we also have to keep in mind that the design of this tool has to be responsive, right.","A"
"586","So once the Spanish has been done.","NULL"
"172","I mean, are there additional configuration issues or any other thing that we would require users for?","NULL"
"188","Yeah.","NULL"
"266","I mean, I don't know how, you know, the functionality, but sometimes if you just try swiping through and then you realize, Oh, that was the wrong side.","NULL"
"286","You know, like I would really like it if you have something like they have on Reddit or somewhere like where you could maybe also as a, you somehow have to involve the users into the survey.","F"
"411","One is an, I don't know, open text question.","NULL"
"618","Yeah.","NULL"
"348","No, but I think we sh we wouldn't have to go that far.","NULL"
"468","Yeah.","NULL"
"552","No, it's okay, I'm listening.","NULL"
"587","So for example, scale question is blah, blah, blah.","NULL"
"55","That makes sense.","NULL"
"311","And then maybe the teams like, Oh yeah, we all need the espresso machine.","NULL"
"434","But what about symptoms?","NULL"
"225","Um, we have to think about how this technically should work such a survey, right.","NULL"
"651","Yeah, I think I'm good.","NULL"
"162","But just so that I understand you right, so that as a user, I don't really have to, um, log in or anything?","F"
"31","Yeah.","NULL"
"508","Yeah, right.","NULL"
"218","I mean, we just talked about those now more or less, but I mean, and, and also now about the communication, so just let me briefly get, um, pinpoint this down.","NULL"
"364","Yeah.","NULL"
"405","And for all the questions we can have all the types, but all in all, I would say for the, um, usability or visibility of the results, it would be good to, to group the question types together.","F"
"648","Yeah.","NULL"
"517","On an iPad, I think, yes.","F"
"602","Maybe they could even add their own translations.","F"
"370","Me, I, as a manager can get feedback in whether people liked and understood the question or not.","F"
"120","And, um, he can filter them.","NULL"
"176","I mean, actually I really like what Mark said.","NULL"
"490","Yeah, it makes sense.","NULL"
"271","Exactly.","NULL"
"393","Yeah right, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"436","Yeah.","NULL"
"132","Yeah.","NULL"
"322","That's for sure a big problem.","NULL"
"559","So we say this project supports English and German and from French.","F"
"546","That's I think that's that, that would be great.","NULL"
"254","Right.","NULL"
"578","No, technically we don't have to, we can hard-code translation, codes, and then simply register translations for these codes.","A"
"70","I don't have to explain what it, what it will do in the end, right?","NULL"
"447","We were, yeah, exactly what the reporting.","NULL"
"6","Yeah.","NULL"
"576","But that is exactly the problem, because if we don't know the languages they are going to use, we cannot hard-code anything","A"
"199","So every other user and team leader belongs to a project manager.","A"
"185","Chris makes, makes a lot of sense because of the stuff you mentioned.","NULL"
"85","Maybe we can talk about the naming later on.","NULL"
"338","The really unnecessary I listen is in his opinion, from the really nice things which he sees worth sharing.","NULL"
"301","Exactly.","NULL"
"406","What do you think about this?","NULL"
"397","Otherwise it would get completely out of hand.","NULL"
"77","Um, yeah, I think, I think I got, I got most of the parts, so let's, let's start.","NULL"
"443","Sorry, I'm back.","NULL"
"661","So I'll just stack get all this information in a readable document and I'll provide you with it.","NULL"
"296","Honestly I cannot say just out of my head, I guess I would have to like do that.","NULL"
"298","Just, just to clarify this, this, if I understood this correctly, this is about users pitching new survey questions.","NULL"
"282","I think I already mentioned something about the engagement in the project description, which I've sent you, but I think we shouldn't go too much in depth with engagement at this point, because it's way out of scope for this first phase.","NULL"
"659","We have to reschedule many more meetings also just with you and your team Janik and Mark with, with the designers as well.","NULL"
"330","Do we have to leave this to the manager?","NULL"
"37","But now we want to have a means that our customers can easily and without much effort create service from wherever they are using their mobile device or also their notebook, whatever, you know, it's just currently in all the survey basis, it's like a trend to ease up the process of creating new service.","F"
"63","I don't think that should be that much of a problem.","NULL"
"100","How much is there to abstract?","NULL"
"99","Yeah.","NULL"
"565","Yeah, I see.","NULL"
"525","How do you mean?","NULL"
"190","So I think, I think, but what Mark was trying to say is that the, the, the simplicity of simply getting an email for the employee, that should be fine because, uh, if, if the project manager or the team leader simply specifies which users to tag in this, um, in this survey and say, or she's simply addressed by their email, that is fine.","F"
"350","So the manager sees, okay, user one set, blah, blah, blah, user two set blah, blah, blah, nothing more than that.","NULL"
"102","I mean, only the managers are allowed to actually run a survey.","F"
"594","Yeah, I need one of these languages.","NULL"
"280","It's the scale question, like some engagement questions and like that, uh, they can only be used to measure engagement or engagement related topics.","F"
"323","So maybe, yeah.","NULL"
"119","So, uh, I think he should be able to see all the, uh, the surveys from the normal metrics by business unit.","F"
"353","This idea of user one is nice.","NULL"
"649","Yeah.","NULL"
"130","Yeah.","NULL"
"107","Do you think this will be a big problem in terms of, um, um, technique, you know, programming?","NULL"
"329","So the math, maybe, maybe we put.","NULL"
"227","I mean, we could probably just stick to our, to our typical survey model where we have scale questions with, with disliking scale and we have open tax questions and we have multiple and single choice questions, right.","F"
"377","I mean, now I really liked that here with the swipe question, I, I wrote this down and also to comment the ability of questions.","NULL"
"93","Maybe it's just simply, can you mute your mic if you're saying something?","NULL"
"571","But now, well, I would give the admin the possibility to correct the translation at least, but just, just as we clear, we are now talking about two different things.","F"
"312","That's a great idea.","NULL"
"147","So I think maybe, yeah, maybe it will make sense to sort of come up with the generalized, um, set of texts.","A"
"534","And if we have time or resources afterwards, in another phase, we can also expand on this.","NULL"
"62","Yeah.","NULL"
"399","Because the manager, they want to be clean, clean, and easy to understand view what's happening within their survey or what are the results.","F"
"642","And if yes, in which form it should come across.","NULL"
