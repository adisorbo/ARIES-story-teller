"id","req_specification","class"
"455","We have to group them, but we have to create a single empathy or wait sheet for each question report.","NULL"
"374","I mean, this is already, you really need degree, the detail work we're doing here.","NULL"
"341","Is there a, an approach for this?","NULL"
"481","That's also why to be called polls service something, you know?","NULL"
"74","Yeah.","NULL"
"221","So, uh, let me just quickly write this down here.","NULL"
"190","So I think, I think, but what Mark was trying to say is that the, the, the simplicity of simply getting an email for the employee, that should be fine because, uh, if, if the project manager or the team leader simply specifies which users to tag in this, um, in this survey and say, or she's simply addressed by their email, that is fine.","F"
"383","So I want to configure it.","NULL"
"219","So I would really like it, if an employee doesn't have to do any, it doesn't have to do anything to, to be part of a project.","A"
"100","How much is there to abstract?","NULL"
"656","Trust me.","NULL"
"596","And then if additional Russian or Japanese or whatever, then probably we have to go with your approach or at least the direction of this approach where we need the customer to.","F"
"44","So this will be asked.","NULL"
"63","I don't think that should be that much of a problem.","NULL"
"508","Yeah, right.","NULL"
"608","Okay.","NULL"
"651","Yeah, I think I'm good.","NULL"
"308","So maybe me as a user can just submit that.","F"
"469","Yeah, of course.","NULL"
"101","Yeah.","NULL"
"159","So they have an account, but they never, uh, they never, they don't have access with this account to the, to our tool.","F"
"572","One is the interactive part, which should be translated for, for the users between them.","F"
"652","Mark, do you have something?","NULL"
"150","I think that's already quite a good input.","NULL"
"188","Yeah.","NULL"
"431","So, so now you're, you're sitting at home enjoying your life or?","NULL"
"208","You don't need a lot of, I mean, we, we talk, um, top level managers of a business here probably to be overkill if, if a business would have more than one managing this, this, this little, um, aspect of the business, right.","NULL"
"82","So maybe let's start with the, with the user roles.","F"
"326","But then you get two emails.","NULL"
"43","So I think there will be something like managers and maybe something like, um, uh, super admin.","F"
"395","I was probably just thinking this for myself, but yeah, that's good that it, that you, yeah.","NULL"
"630","So a manager can just decide, well, I want to share this report in form of PDF.","F"
"646","Yeah, makes sense.","NULL"
"136","I mean, this is just one example, but let's sort of sell predefine them project setups to our customers.","F"
"396","That we are now found the concepts about this, because this will be a really, really important feature.","NULL"
"189","Well, with the user accounts that is actually I think more ideal because then we can actually like pinpoint to specific users and it's not an email floating around somewhere.","NULL"
"24","Sorry.","NULL"
"547","If we could nail this for phase one, actually, yeah.","A"
"247","Cool.","NULL"
"445","This was important.","NULL"
"649","Yeah.","NULL"
"349","I mean, we could just make it so that these ideas are submitted in raw text and then, or displayed and in the report to the manager.","F"
"381","Yeah, it definitely has to be configurable because otherwise let's say I, as a manager, create the survey, complaining five questions.","F"
"293","So this will be a big benefit for the manager in the end, because then he gets ideas and already has them sort of pre-filtered by their importance or, you know, um, on Reddit, they have a similar system when you post something Reddit, people can opt for download it so that the most relevant topics on Reddit in our cases will be ideas they're on the top.","A"
"550","Yeah, yes.","NULL"
"591","Yeah.","NULL"
"128","You're maybe, maybe we can say the project manager can define these texts for his company.","F"
"419","There's someone calling me,","NULL"
"11","Cool.","NULL"
"363","So the comment will be on this question specifically.","NULL"
"7","So let me just quickly.","NULL"
"285","I should've mentioned this earlier, sorry, but maybe, maybe less about the, the actual functionality and more about the design will be really nice.","NULL"
"278","That's actually a really cool idea, but the answer yeah.","NULL"
"510","Because it has to be viewable on different devices.","F"
"403","So some question types are, um, better to be displayed in a specific way.","NULL"
"450","Let's say a survey can only contain so many questions.","A"
"399","Because the manager, they want to be clean, clean, and easy to understand view what's happening within their survey or what are the results.","F"
"562","And from previous projects where I think we handled it the way that our client had to provide translations for the languages they wanted, where we just sent them, Hey, there are the terms like the, these these words and sentences.","F"
"500","I think, I don't know if the programming part will be a lot more complicated.","NULL"
"243","How, how would you solve this if someone uses a traditional computer or notebook?","A"
"5","I mean, you have already seen the email probably about, um, the, this tool we are planning to create, right?","NULL"
"505","I mean, you're right, because the indie individual widgets or, or whatever this is, then they are modular and we can move them without problem.","NULL"
"394","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"614","So we will be building up in phase two and may possible phase three on the existing framework.","NULL"
"318","I I'm, I'm not technical enough to see if this is even yeah, if this makes sense.","NULL"
"297","Um, I think just for the technical side, it should, of course be possible, but I'm not sure about budget or time scope.","NULL"
"530","I like this idea a lot.","NULL"
"428","It's really tough when","NULL"
"612","I mean, that's also, that's quite important for you and your team.","NULL"
"451","Let's say, I don't know, we have to think about this really detailed afterwards.","NULL"
"490","Yeah, it makes sense.","NULL"
"161","What I want to say.","NULL"
"186","So from a technical point of view, Janik, it will be probably easiest that way, right?","NULL"
"465","Yeah, I think you're somewhat right.","NULL"
"181","Like an employee or what do you think?","NULL"
"180","And from there on, he will receive mails, but all this language setting stuff, maybe shouldn't concern that the user, I mean, with user, I mean the survey filler, right?","NULL"
"30","The word document you mean?","NULL"
"379","Wait, wait, wait.","NULL"
"57","Yeah.","NULL"
"390","And then this is a simple flag displayed or not displayed.","F"
"265","Just a quick input.","NULL"
"361","The comment box in your, this is question specific, right.","NULL"
"295","So technically, I mean, we, we have a timeframe of around six months for this phase one, so I'm not sure if this is all working, maybe only you can.","NULL"
"72","Uh, for me, I think it's clear.","NULL"
"386","I know you're the technician guy here and you can say if this is doable or not, but if we include the commands and functionality, this should be toggle.","F"
"110","I mean, depending on how big this entire thing gets, maybe he simply has too many surveys to manage and loses track of what is important.","F"
"532","Let me know what this,","NULL"
"163","I will just get an email?","F"
"542","Yeah.","NULL"
"617","I mean like a really nice coupling also from the front and backend that allows scalability.","A"
"192","Concrete example.","NULL"
"597","Yeah, while on the other hand, we cannot expect this from the customer, they pay for something","NULL"
"501","I think honestly, I don't know.","NULL"
"218","I mean, we just talked about those now more or less, but I mean, and, and also now about the communication, so just let me briefly get, um, pinpoint this down.","NULL"
"344","The question type is it's like an open question texting, but it only serves the purpose for four survey fiddlers to commit their ideas.","NULL"
"663","Cool, guys, thank you so much for your time.","NULL"
"367","Okay.","NULL"
"478","I probably forgot to pinpoint this in the project description, but this tool we're creating here, it, this should be like a easy, short thing.","NULL"
"437","Maybe a little cough.","NULL"
"398","And also the report that results out of survey will be really messed up and bloated with, if every question cook will be commendable, I mean, maybe we can just use this to transition to the reporting system because that's also something which should be like the part of, of course, from an ice service to this, this is really important to, right.","NULL"
"549","Yeah, so that's","NULL"
"259","Would be nice.","NULL"
"552","No, it's okay, I'm listening.","NULL"
"197","And this again would be like a hierarchy that we will have to store and to represent somewhere.","A"
"51","So like the project manager is the admin of his own business?","F"
"338","The really unnecessary I listen is in his opinion, from the really nice things which he sees worth sharing.","NULL"
"494","That's, that's something I just noted it down, but something we have to keep in mind and go more into that.","NULL"
"329","So the math, maybe, maybe we put.","NULL"
"83","So, um, typically the company there will be, uh, like our manager, like, uh, some sort of top manager, maybe, I don't know, maybe a project manager will be suitable word.","F"
"397","Otherwise it would get completely out of hand.","NULL"
"436","Yeah.","NULL"
"183","Yeah.","NULL"
"422","It's a little early, but I manage.","NULL"
"179","And as soon as this happened, he sort of maybe gets a email that says Hey, welcome to the, to this, uh, project.","A"
"31","Yeah.","NULL"
"205","Nah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't do this at the initial, at this point of phase one of our project, because I think we should keep it simple.","NULL"
"20","I think we agreed that we were going to do this on our own, the three of us.","NULL"
"525","How do you mean?","NULL"
"184","I think that's what you just said.","NULL"
"416","Yeah, I can.","NULL"
"157","Yeah.","NULL"
"125","Would that be a fully customizable tag or predefined texts?","F"
"598","So for sure they don't want to provide additional work in order to be able to use it","NULL"
"68","I think it's more important that we actually talk about the different roles too.","F"
"282","I think I already mentioned something about the engagement in the project description, which I've sent you, but I think we shouldn't go too much in depth with engagement at this point, because it's way out of scope for this first phase.","NULL"
"466","But normally the questionnaire is already grouped by, by topic, isn't it?","NULL"
"600","Yeah.","NULL"
"639","Yeah.","NULL"
"91","That's no problem.","NULL"
"67","Yeah, I think so too.","NULL"
"164","Uh, yeah, exactly.","NULL"
"360","And that was the idea for, for the common box, but not for every question.","NULL"
"45","I mean, we need some, some, uh, sort of, um, possibility to manage this entire tool.","F"
"18","Isn't he joining the meeting today?","NULL"
"107","Do you think this will be a big problem in terms of, um, um, technique, you know, programming?","NULL"
"143","Right.","NULL"
"75","Um, from my side, I think it is mostly clear.","NULL"
"312","That's a great idea.","NULL"
"378","So people can, if the manager allows command specific questions, which I really liked this skip some sort of inclusion,","F"
"618","Yeah.","NULL"
"411","One is an, I don't know, open text question.","NULL"
"342","You can use the Reddit approach again, where you can have comments you can upvote or downvote and then you can.","F"
"528","So you use it just to make the reporting responsive so you can always view what's happening.","F"
"8","Wait, wait.","NULL"
"98","Depends on what they should be able to do.","NULL"
"54","Yeah.","NULL"
"209","Yeah.","NULL"
"277","Yeah.","NULL"
"1","Let's do it.","NULL"
"250","Okay.","NULL"
"537","Yeah.","NULL"
"286","You know, like I would really like it if you have something like they have on Reddit or somewhere like where you could maybe also as a, you somehow have to involve the users into the survey.","F"
"650","I mean, the other thing is also quite interesting, but at this point, I think a bit overkill, I liked the idea, but we also move this really, really in the back of the priority list.","NULL"
"131","The team leaders or the employees could, could simply select out of these predefined tags.","F"
"140","But I get your point on that.","NULL"
"372","So he can really add new ideas or innovative ideas, or maybe even this way, patients, which then can generally be seen by others and the opera download it.","F"
"496","What do you guys think about, make about creating an adjustable report?","NULL"
"266","I mean, I don't know how, you know, the functionality, but sometimes if you just try swiping through and then you realize, Oh, that was the wrong side.","NULL"
"245","Yeah.","NULL"
"103","So, um, for a project manager, he should be able to run surveys to all of the business, including all of the employees and stop or didn't managers such as maybe possible team and actress should only be able to create service including their own team and maybe some organic teams, you know how I mean?","F"
"517","On an iPad, I think, yes.","F"
"583","And if the user logs in with a Spanish setting, he will get the Spanish translation for it.","F"
"626","It may be, I mean, there will be a lot of graphical elements in such a report like charts and yeah.","F"
"533","I think for the beginning, this would surely be enough.","NULL"
"322","That's for sure a big problem.","NULL"
"99","Yeah.","NULL"
"160","So they're just having an account such that, uh, the managers can send them, uh, uh, emails, you know what I mean?","F"
"446","So where were we?","NULL"
"3","Uh, let me just quickly get my notes.","NULL"
"42","And depending on your user role, you have different rights.","F"
"154","I'm wondering, do you think it is necessary for users to even have like a in or something?","NULL"
"118","Yeah, I think this would be a good approach.","NULL"
"168","That's what I meant.","NULL"
"632","You guys hear me?","NULL"
"307","So the users should have the possibility to bring in their own ideas, should the manager have missed them.","F"
"454","Yeah.","NULL"
"509","I mean, that's, that's good that you mentioned the point of, of, of how it actually should look in there because here, we also have to keep in mind that the design of this tool has to be responsive, right.","A"
"269","I think we should add this because, or we should add something like in the end, uh, the questions can be pre viewed again before submitting.","NULL"
"580","Let's say you have the translation code, which should the books scale.","NULL"
"241","At the bottom side is, I don't know, or I don't care.","F"
"593","I mean, I like this, but probably you should, we should just start with the English German French set, because the most of our customers are either one of these.","F"
"90","Should I, uh?","NULL"
"502","I mean, if, if you, if we cook cleanly keep the different clearly keep the different elements and report apart from each other, sort of have different objects of classes.","NULL"
"566","Yeah.","NULL"
"345","So just keep in mind, open text is evil.","NULL"
"313","And others have have also this, this option to, to select or comment on.","F"
"146","I mean, we ha we, we don't, we have a lot of customers, but it's still quite, um, well, it's, we, we don't serve the whole world.","NULL"
"590","Okay.","NULL"
"271","Exactly.","NULL"
"571","But now, well, I would give the admin the possibility to correct the translation at least, but just, just as we clear, we are now talking about two different things.","F"
"493","I like this idea.","NULL"
"553","I actually have a different question.","NULL"
"400","So I'm not sure here how we should actually display the results of these different questions.","NULL"
"25","I haven't seen this email.","NULL"
"480","But here it's just together a claims like the manager really wants to fill the polls of his team in a specific topic.","NULL"
"242","And then, uh, one can take the, the question that is depicted like a card and can just swipe it to the area wherever you want.","F"
"413","And now if you propose that they are not, they are not, uh, connected, but they are grouped into their types.","NULL"
"152","I mean, there, there will also of course be this, the role of the employee or of the servery filler him or herself, right.","F"
"248","Could we just also like make, make the, the side thingy a button like that you could just, instead of swiping also just click there.","NULL"
"311","And then maybe the teams like, Oh yeah, we all need the espresso machine.","NULL"
"408","But what if semantically, they don't fit?","NULL"
"228","Well, I would pitch put, I would pitch this to the creativity department.","NULL"
"84","Uh, let me just quickly write this down here as a side note.","NULL"
"337","It's like the manager then will be like a first filter that filters out.","F"
"518","I mean, think about, think about the manager who's often walking around or visiting different I don't know, departments, and instead of laptops, they have iPads.","NULL"
"113","Right.","NULL"
"172","I mean, are there additional configuration issues or any other thing that we would require users for?","NULL"
"348","No, but I think we sh we wouldn't have to go that far.","NULL"
"662","Okay, all right.","NULL"
"635","Okay, cool.","NULL"
"489","So just like to, to Mark different parts of the survey, similar to the tasks, similar to the texts, you, you can create a group and then assign, let's say three questions to this group, but in the entire survey you'll have up to eight questions.","F"
"557","So yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"227","I mean, we could probably just stick to our, to our typical survey model where we have scale questions with, with disliking scale and we have open tax questions and we have multiple and single choice questions, right.","F"
"438","My friends it's the only rough, but otherwise probably same as me.","NULL"
"659","We have to reschedule many more meetings also just with you and your team Janik and Mark with, with the designers as well.","NULL"
"6","Yeah.","NULL"
"541","That's also really important.","NULL"
"314","Okay.","NULL"
"116","I think it's really important that we come up with a neat design where let's say a project manager, he can feel there and he can also customize his, um, dashboard.","F"
"145","Because we need, I mean, you know, you work now in our business for quite a while, both of you, so, you know, the set of customers you already have.","NULL"
"267","Is there intended to be a functionality to retrieve a card?","F"
"576","But that is exactly the problem, because if we don't know the languages they are going to use, we cannot hard-code anything","A"
"21","Uh, this information didn't reach me, but, uh, that's fine with me.","NULL"
"281","But maybe I have, yeah.","NULL"
"327","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"229","What kind of, what kind of questions are there?","NULL"
"382","So if it's not configurable, so all these five questions can be commendable, right?","NULL"
"142","Yeah.","NULL"
"46","Right.","NULL"
"607","So all the elements are there in three different languages and their manager, he can switch the language somewhere on a taco to his liking.","F"
"129","So yeah, that would make sense.","NULL"
"512","Okay, I see.","NULL"
"526","So like the, the actual configuration would probably happen on a, on a desktop or laptop, but for, for the single reporting, if you are in a meeting, you have your iPad with you.","NULL"
"507","Yeah. I would have that I would have to, to also dive in and, and make an estimation for,","NULL"
"429","Yeah, last week, last Friday.","NULL"
"441","Okay.","NULL"
"76","I mean, this is, as you said, a, a tool for, for survey management or like creation and organization and reporting.","F"
"366","Yeah.","NULL"
"40","So they just sign up in order to use the services and, um, the service as itself.","F"
"391","Okay, yeah, okay.","NULL"
"166","So the manager will actually create this user and then the user is sort of in the system and will receive the emails on the email address which the managers specified.","F"
"222","Um, yeah.","NULL"
"439","Yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"324","I don't know.","NULL"
"346","As in, if you have simple possibilities, then the processing is also simple.","NULL"
"177","I mean, yeah.","NULL"
"535","Yes.","NULL"
"357","I was not, I was not talking about every question, but for, for the follow-up survey, but for, for, for when you can like, or dislike, uh, other ideas, or maybe you want to add something to it","F"
"482","So these should be quick, quick and reoccurring service.","NULL"
"89","Uh, this, my mother [inaudible], um, she's finished in two minutes.","NULL"
"303","I'd say it's about employee motivation.","NULL"
"65","Then on, on the front end side, you can simple check on with which users, uh, you are logged in currently, which roles they have, and then you can simply for each element checked through for which roles it should be displayed.","F"
"182","I think Mark, you, you, you have the right track on this.","NULL"
"627","I mean, other bar plots and so on.","F"
"424","It's always.","NULL"
"539","And also in the survey interface, you can fill out the questions.","F"
"215","So apart from, from the, from the mailing list, um, which Mark, uh, mentioned, what else is there?","NULL"
"273","That's, that will be really important there.","NULL"
"216","I mean, are there specifics we, we need to discuss or that they're unclear or.","NULL"
"563","Are there, can you translate them?","NULL"
"631","Can","NULL"
"274","Hm.","NULL"
"544","So we have two elements with which for sure need to be responsive, which is the reporting and survey mask.","F"
"655","I certainly come back to you.","NULL"
"610","Okay.","NULL"
"524","Which would mean it's maybe on two different platforms.","A"
"448","Well, I think maybe we should, we should limit the service to specific topics, right?","A"
"464","We will have to include really complicated the algorithms, maybe even NLP or something, which should be way out of scope.","NULL"
"231","Yeah, we need something fancy looking and also something innovative.","A"
"504","It depends on, on how we entirely approach the thing.","NULL"
"280","It's the scale question, like some engagement questions and like that, uh, they can only be used to measure engagement or engagement related topics.","F"
"199","So every other user and team leader belongs to a project manager.","A"
"236","Um, yeah, I noted some types of questions here in preparation for this awesome meeting.","NULL"
"426","Yes, since I got tested positive.","NULL"
"359","Or, or explain why you don't like it.","NULL"
"141","Technically it should be possible to do so.","NULL"
"474","This is the point, which I think Mark, you haven't really understood.","NULL"
"443","Sorry, I'm back.","NULL"
"319","It's such a comment.","NULL"
"636","So what's this, what's this your question?","NULL"
"275","Okay.","NULL"
"642","And if yes, in which form it should come across.","NULL"
"527","Oh, I see.","NULL"
"423","Stressful day.","NULL"
"407","Just like maybe all the open text questions are grouped together in the report and all other types of questions are also grouped together,","A"
"665","Yes, they have to be Recording.","NULL"
"105","I'm not really sure here.","NULL"
"384","Only question three out of five should be commended.","NULL"
"106","Maybe we have to think about this.","NULL"
"173","Yeah.","NULL"
"354","So let's somehow include in the next survey.","NULL"
"48","I mean, is there a regular admin?","NULL"
"92","No, no, that's okay.","NULL"
"334","That, yeah, it's just up to the manager, up to the manager to see what came in in this specific survey, right?","NULL"
"435","No, nothing.","NULL"
"657","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","NULL"
"503","So it shouldn't be so much of an issue to move these blocks around, right?","NULL"
"491","Yes.","NULL"
"405","And for all the questions we can have all the types, but all in all, I would say for the, um, usability or visibility of the results, it would be good to, to group the question types together.","F"
"644","I think they just want to have nice widgets, which they can include in their internal meetings or yeah.","F"
"97","So I don't know how have you got, see, but I think it's quite important that we specify how many abstraction levels of roles we want.","A"
"151","Okay.","NULL"
"94","Oh yeah.","NULL"
"335","So he, at the end, in the report, he sees all the feedback of the users, but then he himself can decide which of these he liked.","A"
"555","Yep.","NULL"
"167","Yeah.","NULL"
"234","I think you're both muted, but maybe, maybe, so maybe Mark, can you hear me now?","NULL"
"332","And then that then remains the question with, with the voting.","A"
"432","Uh, I wouldn't say yeah.","NULL"
"521","Maybe not the iPhone, but at least the tablets.","F"
"568","I mean, I was just also the other day I was searching the net and I found DeepL this translation API, and maybe it would also be possible to include some sort of deeper API as in if a manager or now if a user creates an English question, people will automatically translate it to German storing the germ part of this question.","F"
"621","Maybe we should leave it at that for now because I have another meeting, which I have to attend soon.","NULL"
"175","So we also have to consider language settings for users. I'm not really sure how we could address this problem.","A"
"514","Maybe you can grasp this a bit better Janik, but, or maybe also you Mark as a UX specialist,","NULL"
