"1593"," All of that has to be...We can't mark the entire clause. We can mark that line as being complete.","NULL"
"1594"," I think Susan has a good point. We just need to ask Kevin if he wants to do a nice clean sweep of it all, or if he wants to leave the clause hanging forever.","NULL"
"1595"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1596"," It could be because he won't slow us back, but they're going to go in and clean them up. I don't know, but I can ask. Is it two no clause, and three if it's clause? If we have to do the clause.","NULL"
"1597"," Is that it?","NULL"
"1598"," No. Sit down.","NULL"
"1599"," Trying to get out of things. I have to write my notes. I will send him an email. It will probably be Monday before I send that email because my hair appointment got changed to 11:30. I will definitely be leaving. So the other one...","NULL"
"1600","  to interview, unless you think he just wants to hear back from you.","NULL"
"1601"," What I was going to do, was write up what we've discussed. That's what I usually do when I send him something back that says, ""Here is our understanding of your request."" If we do this, then it's two points, if we clean up the clause, then it's three points.","NULL"
"1602"," I basically write what I would put in the story of the email back to him, so that it makes sense to me. Then if he signs off on it, that's what goes in the story. If he comes back and says, ""Oh, but what about this?"" Then I update and send it back to him.","NULL"
"1603"," You're welcome to try that if you want to.","NULL"
"1604"," I can try.","NULL"
"1605"," Yes, and if you don't mind send that to me, and then if it's OK then I'll forward it on to him, because I can check my emails after I get home today.","NULL"
"1606"," Yes, absolutely. That's what I'll do.","NULL"
"1607"," OK, thank you. That's good.","NULL"
"1608"," I'll draft it up and send it to you.","NULL"
"1609"," OK. That sounds great. The other thing that we were going to talk about, and  you were copied on this from Smiley. It says scanner, but this is where they wanted to talk about the wireless scanners to use with LCAM.","NULL"
"1610"," I'm just going to give the guys an update. I talked to Smiley yesterday about what specifically he means, and in his mind he means is what we mean when we say wireless scanner. It acts just like a tethered scanner, but it's wireless.","NULL"
"1611"," The guy in the field who's wanting this functionality is thinking more of an offline scanner where you sit it into a...","NULL"
"1612"," Docking station.","NULL"
"1613"," A docking station and it uploads a buttload of data at one time. I told him that I have a meeting set up to talk to you guys about this, but that the offline scanners is definitely way more complex than wireless scanners.","NULL"
"1614"," It may not even come to pass, because the whole deal is the people in the field are doing cycle counts. Can you give a brief explanation of cycle counts so we're not the same page of what we're talking about?","NULL"
"1615"," A cycle count is where they go out and look and see what spare equipment they have in these spare cabinets, and LCAM says one thing, and what's actually in the field could be different so it has to be reconciled to what's there and what LCAM has. I don't often Kevin, do you know how often you do cycle counts?","NULL"
"1616"," The field does, and this is who it's for. It's for a Williams, Bill Williams, I believe it is. He's a team leader of the techs in the field. They do it once a month. They go into their maintenance containers, and they reconcile what's in their maintenance against what LCAM says is supposed to be in their maintenance.","NULL"
"1617"," Except that they're behind.","NULL"
"1618"," Well, this I just like...they get time allotted. The techs get time allotted to do this so it's only now in my view they're making these containers. It's not everything, just that. They go in.","NULL"
"1619"," I think right now they're printing off their inventory files and just doing a manual check off of, yes, this is what's in there, no this is...They want an easier, quicker way of doing it, and also using the cycle counts feature to do it.","NULL"
"1620"," So in LCAM they're...yes, OK, so that's why I wanted to talk to you guys, because this sounds like we could possibly let them use DC3 to do this functionality.","NULL"
"1621"," That's what I was wondering.","NULL"
"1622"," But it won't be the CinBell DC3 that they have currently because that's warehouse, and it expects you to do the whole  . It's not at the container level. So maybe do we need...?","NULL"
"1623"," You probably need Patrick for that.","NULL"
"1624"," Let me see if I can get Patrick. I'll be right back.","NULL"
"1625"," Patrick's our DC3 expert. It's his baby.","NULL"
"1626"," Yes. He showed me when I first got here a little bit.","NULL"
"1627"," He's very protective of it. That's my opinion.","NULL"
"1628"," This would mean that DC3 would need to be loaded on those techs' laptops?","NULL"
"1629"," That's what I'm thinking, and maybe is that what you're thinking, too?","NULL"
"1630"," I don't know how they use DC3. It guess so.","NULL"
"1631"," When you all did the warehouse...","NULL"
"1632"," You were there, weren't you?","NULL"
"1634"," And today they're not doing them in LCAM. They just go off and...They print off their inventory and then they checklist it as they're doing their cycle count.","NULL"
"1635"," Patrick's here.","NULL"
"1636"," The thought of having Kevin Smiley's thought with the wireless is that they can take a laptop over to their storage cabinet and scan, and it'll talk to...or if they have a desktop, it can talk wirelessly.","NULL"
"1637"," They've got the scanner. They can have their cycle count up and scan the stuff in. That stuff sounds more like DC3, which I did have that thought when I was talking to him about it. I don't know why I didn't invite you to this meeting. My bad.","NULL"
"1638"," If you wanted to do a cycle count that was entirely on the web side of things it's basically like what you're talking about doing a bay audit where you just take the raw data from somewhere, dump it into LCAM, look at it up there, make your adjustments, and then push it through that way.","NULL"
"1639"," You could also do that entirely on DC3. Right now it only works at the  level so you'd have to adjust it to where it would only narrow down to a particular frame ID. The challenge there is that with the whole recon process that's there it's a little bit overkill in a sense.","NULL"
"1640"," Yes, and this is like techs in the field doing it. The learning curve could be huge.","NULL"
"1641"," They can spell their name and that's about it.","NULL"
"1642"," ","NULL"
"1643"," What did he say?","NULL"
"1644"," They can spell their name.","NULL"
"1645"," Say how you really feel  . ","NULL"
"1646"," I'm saying it, that's how it is.","NULL"
"1647"," He's been there. He's seen it.","NULL"
"1648"," We could modify DC3 to maybe smooth out that process a little bit to where it's not as complicated, or streamline it. You can go either way. You're basically either...you've got to simplify the process in DC3 to only work at the frame ID level and strip out a lot of the...","NULL"
"1649"," The recon process is for the whole location, and it's pretty granular as far as being able to make adjustments as you go along so you get the whole inventory for the whole office just right before you actually push the button to pump it back into LCAM.","NULL"
"1650"," The plus side about that is you use laptops and just simple, inexpensive 2D barcode scanners that you already have to do all that if they wanted to do the bay audit kind of a thing. There was a cycle count function in there at one point in time, right?","NULL"
"1651"," It's still there. How does it work? I'm sorry, I've just forgot?","NULL"
"1652"," How do you put information into it?","NULL"
"1653"," Does it stop it from sourcing when you say you're doing a cycle count?","NULL"
"1654"," No, you're talking warehouse. Warehouse cycle count is different from the field.","NULL"
"1655"," I don't think I ever tested the field cycle count. How does it work in LCAM?","NULL"
"1656"," You just go to that page and say you were doing a cycle count for this  . I don't know if it's  end bay. I think it is,  end frame.  end frame, and then you just say, ""OK, I've got eight of these plugs, nine of this one.""","NULL"
"1657"," Do you just key it all in, basically?","NULL"
"1658"," Just key it in. You scan the  , and then you put a count, basically.","NULL"
"1659"," Ah, so this. It looks like I've got 12 of these.","NULL"
"1660"," Then it adds it to the list. You keep doing that until you...","NULL"
"1661"," Will this take scanning information?","NULL"
"1662"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1663"," How do you scan it? Do you just have a really long cord to go from your computer, or do you use a laptop?","NULL"
"1664"," You use a laptop and the tethered scanner.","NULL"
"1665"," With WiFi or something?","NULL"
"1666"," Yes.","NULL"
"1667"," Go ahead and finish what you're saying.","NULL"
"1668"," I don't know what I was saying. Once you do that you hit submit, and then it brings up a screen for you to reconcile them.","NULL"
"1669"," If I hit submit here, it's going to give me a bunch of crap.","NULL"
"1670"," You in production?","NULL"
"1671"," Now. Request web post data. Don't do that to me, David.","NULL"
"1672"," You did that on purpose.","NULL"
"1673"," It says test at the bottom.","NULL"
"1674"," It doesn't matter.","NULL"
"1675"," Are you logging is as CinBell?","NULL"
"1676"," No. I'm on  .","NULL"
"1677"," That really doesn't mean anything. It used to put a file on the FTP server, but now if you go back to...","NULL"
"1678"," ","NULL"
"1679"," You've got to remember what  you use...","NULL"
"1680"," Process?","NULL"
"1681"," Yes.","NULL"
"1682"," What the heck. Can't type.","NULL"
"1683"," I don't think you need that. You maybe do. I don't know. Just hit fine. There you go.","NULL"
"1684"," So you go to...","NULL"
"1685"," Yes.","NULL"
"1686"," And then it tells me, ""This is all the stuff you have. I'm going to talk it all away because you didn't give me anything but D4 D4 SB.""","NULL"
"1687"," The easier thing to do is have Data Collector. The previous screen do something similar in Data Collector and then do a web service call. I don't know what that XML file is, if that's anything.","NULL"
"1688"," I don't even think it's reading it.","NULL"
"1689"," There's a table count in there so let's add a web service call that allows DC3 to manipulate that one table, and then after they upload their cycle count into LCAM from Data Collector they'd go to this same screen and keep going.","NULL"
"1690"," Do their reconciliation.","NULL"
"1691"," I have a couple of questions. When they're doing this cycle count can the equipment be moving behind the scenes?","NULL"
"1692"," Can it be moving? What do you mean?","NULL"
"1693"," Like are you preventing anything?","NULL"
"1694"," No.","NULL"
"1695"," OK.","NULL"
"1696"," The point is they're dealing with one frame ID. They need to take a Post-it note and stick it on the front of there saying, ""Don't touch.""","NULL"
"1697"," Here's the other issue that CinBell is dealing with, and the reason that DC3 may actually be a better solution is a lot of these sites they don't have WiFi at, and they don't have LCAM.","NULL"
"1698"," They just started having these meetings so Smiley is offering them, or discussing a couple of proposals. He's like, ""You all need to put in WiFi at all these locations so that they can get to somewhere where there's LCAM. That's $500 a pop to put in some kind of WiFi connection at all these sites that don't have them.","NULL"
"1699"," But if they can do DC3 they don't have to have it, right? They can start somewhere where they have WiFi and say, ""I'm going to do this when I get there."" When they go there they can do it, come back.","NULL"
"1700"," That has been the only reason that we've ever continued to mess with client applications on a laptop so that you can do stuff like that without an Internet connection otherwise I'd be out of a job, probably.","NULL"
"1701"," We need to give a proposal back to them that's a win/win for everybody.  Where's the Kool-Aid? I'm drinking it.","NULL"
"1702"," If we add a web service call so that DC3 can populate this screen from data that has been collected on the laptop throughout the day then, yes, they could manage this process bay by bay using this.","NULL"
"1703"," Now if they're doing the entire  then they would run it as a full-blown inventory.","NULL"
"1704"," Yes, and at this point they're strictly talking about these cycle counts. Their field people are trying to find a way to make it quicker and easier for them to do their cycle counts.","NULL"
"1705"," I need to add a function in DC3 to let them create a new task just locally for a bay and a frame. We'd need to add a web service call in LCAM for DC3 to be able push that data up to this table here.","NULL"
"1706"," I'd say both of those you could do that, and you could do that in five days. That's the happy path. I don't find anything else along the way.","NULL"
"1707"," Five days.","NULL"
"1708"," Total.","NULL"
"1709"," Total, OK.","NULL"
"1710"," Both for DC3 and for LCAM.","NULL"
"1711"," This has got to be cheaper than buying wireless scanners.","NULL"
"1712"," Oh, yeah, because you're going to have to do the exact same thing with the wireless scanners. The thing that people don't realize about wireless scanners is it's basically you have to make a whole new app to run inside of them. It's a Windows mobile device just like that conduit thing unless you...","NULL"
"1713"," Now there are some off the shelf ones where they will gather just dumb barcode scans, and it'll output them, but at that point none of it's validated. What if they scan a manufacturer's serial number instead of the  or something like that?","NULL"
"1714"," That's the other half of why you deal with laptops out in the field, because you can validate against the catalog while you're standing in front of the thing as opposed to I've gathered a pile of barcodes. Now let's try to do something with it, right?","NULL"
"1715"," Caleb, do you know do all the field techs have laptops or not? Do you know?","NULL"
"1716"," They used to not, no. The COs have their dedicated work stations, things like that for LKM and everything. They have tablets of some sort, I believe, the techs do, but central office technicians I don't think, and I may be wrong, but I don't think that they all have their own individual laptops.","NULL"
"1717"," Are there enough floater owner laptops around to where if a tech needs to go out and say, ""Hey, I need to spend an afternoon doing these cycle counts,"" he could get one?","NULL"
"1718"," I'm sure they could find some along the way, but once again there's like a Kevin Smiley question. To me I think they just wanted to have login in to LCAM and click the cycle count function button on there and then a have a cordless, wireless scanner be able to talk to LCAM just let them do the function directly into LCAM.","NULL"
"1719"," Yeah, but part of the problem with that is they don't have WiFi at all of the locations so their wireless scanners would not work to connect to LCAM at those locations. There's a couple of issues that they're trying to solve.","NULL"
"1720"," Right. Kevin, he talked to me about it as well.","NULL"
"1721"," Go back to that first screen. The problem there is at that point you're back to the problem of just a dumb scanner clicking barcodes. If you programmed the scanner just right you could set it up to where they just blindly scanned the  . They wouldn't be able to adjust any quantities so if they had 50 of something on the same shelf they'd have to scan the barcode 50 times.","NULL"
"1722"," What does that do?","NULL"
"1723"," It just...","NULL"
"1724"," It should combine them when you...","NULL"
"1725"," Do you tab or enter key?","NULL"
"1726"," It's a tab.","NULL"
"1727"," It's a push tab.","NULL"
"1728"," Yes.","NULL"
"1729"," Now do the same one again and then tab.","NULL"
"1730"," I think when you...","NULL"
"1731"," So here now what happens?","NULL"
"1732"," That was what Smiley was trying to bring up to them even with wireless scanners someone's got to be wherever to handle this.","NULL"
"1733"," And that's the problem. OK, so now you're back to you need validation, which means you need a smart scanner, which means you need an app that is specifically coded for that smart scanner, and at that point you're talking about something that costs more than a laptop and tethered 1D USB barcode scanner.","NULL"
"1734"," You're talking back porch now. ","NULL"
"1735"," What do you mean?","NULL"
"1736"," Barcode from porch...","NULL"
"1737"," Exactly.","NULL"
"1738"," Then we'll have side shift.","NULL"
"1739"," If you want validation then, OK, you need a smart scanner which is expensive and cumbersome programming-wise or you need a laptop.","NULL"
"1740"," Yes, and if they do it with offline scanners then that's a huge change for LCAM. It's way more than five days' work if they go with offline scanners.","NULL"
"1741"," You're building an entirely new app. That's what it amounts to, which back in the day that's how you used to do inventories, and it eventually got to the point where a laptop and a tethered scanner is cheaper and easier.","NULL"
"1742"," OK.","NULL"
"1743"," OK, so that's the validation problem, and then the other problem is connectivity. That's, again, why a laptop deals with that one.","NULL"
"1744"," I think that we should just, Susan and us should just go back to Kevin and tell him that DC3 can...modify DC3 with a tethered scanner would be the most feasible and cheapest way to go to be able to do what they wanted to do.","NULL"
"1745"," Yes, that's what it sounded like to me, too. That's why we're having this meeting is to decide what's...because what they actually want to accomplish is to be able to do their cycle counts quickly and efficiently and cheaply, because nobody wants to spend money they don't have to spend.","NULL"
"1746"," If we can modify DC3 and LCAM so that they can do that, as long as they can provide the laptops and it doesn't have to be a dedicated laptop. They can have a pool of laptops that have DC3 loaded on them that the techs go pick up when they're going to go do their cycle count, and then turn them back in when they're done or whatever.","NULL"
"1747"," One of the other things to maybe put on there is you could probably put another five days on there. One thing I want to do is change the database that it runs in. Right now it runs off of SQL Express, which is basically installing a small version SQL Server on the laptop itself.","NULL"
"1748"," Microsoft, they came up with...what is it called? Local DB. SQL Express is its own Window service that runs as an entirely separate Windows service. They have a version called Local DB which is a process. When your program connects to a local DB database it's not a Window service that's already running in the background, but it kicks off an even more stripped down version of SQL Server that runs as just a plain old process.","NULL"
"1749"," The installation for that is a lot easier. If you've ever done a SQL Express install it's this big old long thing. It still is a separate Microsoft install, but it's more like you're installing a PDF viewer or just some old plain utility app.","NULL"
"1750"," It's a lot easier install. It's a lot smaller footprint on the computer, and it's not a Windows server that's constantly running. It only spools up after you start Data Collector and start using it that way. That's one of the things that's on the list.","NULL"
"1751"," We could make it work, but it would force them to do a full-blown SQL Express install if they wanted to use it this way. That's just something else that I wanted to do especially for this case. If they say, ""Hey, we need a laptop to do this thing,"" well, they would need this local DB set up and DC3 setup, and it would be maybe 10 minutes' worth of installing as opposed to...","NULL"
"1752"," Like the half a day it took to get one of those...","NULL"
"1753"," Yeah, so that's the thing, too, is you could have an end user do a SQL Express install, but it's pretty...it's scary-looking for them, right?","NULL"
"1754"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1755"," That's one of the old technical thing to throw in there.","NULL"
"1756"," That's good to have. That would be like another five days.","NULL"
"1757"," I call it five days, yeah. Around five days to implement that.","NULL"
"1758"," So those are valid estimates I can give them?","NULL"
"1759"," Sure. They're ballpark. If we're just...","NULL"
"1760"," If we were going with a not too exceed estimate would you make it even bigger?","NULL"
"1761"," My numbers tie then.","NULL"
"1762"," Of what I know before actually diving into it that's what it feels like.","NULL"
"1763"," OK. It's only because I'm going to give it to them so I don't want it to come back.","NULL"
"1764"," If you want not to exceed estimates, double it. If you want not to exceed estimates double it, but that's just random padding at that point.","NULL"
"1765"," I prefer to come in under.  Either way, if we wind up going over they're still not going to pay over five if I tell them five so that's where my question is coming from.","NULL"
"1766"," Unless they want to count this as their maintenance stuff. They get maintenance points, right?","NULL"
"1767"," We were having this discussion about what's covered in maintenance.","NULL"
"1768"," They get maintenance but I don't know what...","NULL"
"1769"," How much?","NULL"
"1770"," I don't know how much or...what's considered maintenance to you?","NULL"
"1771"," I can take all of this stuff to Darrell and to Brett and discuss what's considered maintenance, what could be...","NULL"
"1772"," I thought the license included X number of days of just development work, not a lot, but...","NULL"
"1773"," And I honestly don't remember.","NULL"
"1774"," Can they do the buy of DC3?","NULL"
"1775"," Do what?","NULL"
"1776"," Did they buy DC3?","NULL"
"1777"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1778"," They did.","NULL"
"1779"," They bought it.","NULL"
"1780"," For the warehouse. ","NULL"
"1781"," They bought it. It's theirs, so if they want to spend some maintenance points or some money to enhance it to do this other thing it's theirs to use. You can tell Kevin, too, look, that extra five days is to give you the autonomy to be able to do this on your own otherwise you're going to have to get IT involved.","NULL"
"1782"," I guess the other thing you can mention to Kevin Smiley is one of the things we ran into while we were up there is there's a difference between laptops that lived inside of their corporate network that were really tightly controlled, and had a bunch of security stuff that gets preloaded on it and everything.","NULL"
"1783"," You could run on a laptop that's outside of the corporate network but you'd need the VPN client. To be able to talk to LCAM you'd have to run a VPN client to make that connection, and if you have...","NULL"
"1784"," For example, our Alden laptops are an example of that. I could bring it in there. I had access to the public Internet from their network in the warehouse. It would get me to the public Internet, but I couldn't get to LCAM itself until I ran the VPN client, like we do here.","NULL"
"1785"," If they're outside the corporate network then they need the VPN client to run LCAM on the laptops.","NULL"
"1786"," To talk to LCAM on the laptop.","NULL"
"1787"," OK.","NULL"
"1788"," If they wanted the most autonomy running something like that give us the five days so we could use this local DB thing. It'd be a lot easier for an end user to install. Run a laptop that's outside the corporate network so they have admin and access to it to do the installs, and then you could talk to LCAM with VPN. They should be able to do it that way.","NULL"
"1789"," OK. I think that gives us enough to go back with a proposal to Kevin, which actually that proposal will probably wind up coming from Brett because when money's involved it's supposed to go through Brett unless it's part of a release, and what we're proposing would not be part of a...I mean we would have a release for it, but the DC3 part of it...","NULL"
"1790"," Ask Darrell if there's an option for him to spend maintenance points on it.","NULL"
"1791"," Yeah, that's what I need to do is get with Darrell and Brett and go, ""What are they paying us this license fee for? What does it cover?"" Because I don't know, and I need to know. All right. I think that's it.","NULL"
"1792"," Thanks everybody. Talk you later, Caleb. Bye.","NULL"
"1793"," Are we making changes, get the new view, new view model, and even if you want to start making the changes to taking out the reference to the old user control...","NULL"
"1794"," That will temporarily break it, right?","NULL"
"1795"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1796"," Until we get the new look.","NULL"
"1797"," If you get familiar with XAML, you could split the screen, and put two controls side-by-side. It's going to reduce our real estate on the screen and stuff, but you could split it, split the two columns and put each control in there, and see if we can get them side-by-side might actually be useful for testing, and comparison, and such.","NULL"
"1798"," That's a good idea, maybe that.","NULL"
"1799"," Then you can slowly move one function over at a time.","NULL"
"1800"," That's a good idea. Easy peasy.","NULL"
"1801"," I'm going to have to check these changes in though, too, so you will have them.","NULL"
"1802"," I'll just get recent...","NULL"
"1803"," Yeah, give me the latest version.","NULL"
"1804"," OK.","NULL"
"1805"," I'll do that. Let me get back to my desk, compile a few times, make sure I haven't broken anything, and then I'll check that in and make sure there's no...I'll make sure the application... make sure it still runs. OK, I'll go and check it in. I don't have any TFS, I have to check it in again so I'll see if we have anything to check it in. Have you done any of that yet?","NULL"
"1806"," Done what?","NULL"
"1807"," Have you checked any code in whatsoever?","NULL"
"1808"," No.","NULL"
"1809"," That's OK, it might be worthwhile. All right, so it's got the two changes, that is. Ouch, the project change. I'm sorry. That's it. How would I do this? Alright I take everything and exclude it first, so that I don't accidentally check any of this other stuff in. It's got stuff all over. All right, here's our current project. I'm just going to include that, include that, include these two items. That's it, and update it.  I don't know why they changed. It's probably part of the stuff I was doing  .","NULL"

"1822"," I think that's it. Everything you check in should be associated with a task, if at all possible.

Anyway, we do have a task. That's your name associated with it. We checked in code against it. Any more time that you spend on this particular task, you can do that and also add another task for updating the... .","NULL"
"1823"," That shouldn't take too terribly long. Put an hour on it. The product managers, before every planning meeting, before every stand-up, they want you to have your task out there. Every story should have your task associated with it, and every task should have some hours on it.","NULL"
"1824"," That's what they're expecting, every time you go to a stand-up meeting. That helps them. You just have some of the managed projects. It should be a lot shorter, because all you're going to say, do you have any obstacles in your way from getting this work done, or anything like that, and have you updated your time.","NULL"

"1890"," I know.  .","NULL"
"1891"," Well, you can talk to Brian. Brian had a team that worked like that at the beginning, and he said it was just a nightmare to figure it out.","NULL"

"1900"," You can, but...","NULL"
"1901"," Or we can do it at a different time.","NULL"
"1902"," We've got two hours, so...","NULL"
"1903"," I guess my first thought is, if you're going to have a bunch of Notify stories, like Karen's doing them, some of them relate to the  .","NULL"
"1904"," What? You could have two different teams working on the same code base, and they'd still have the same release, is what Brian said. You could have people on the HTML5 team that are getting those stories, and other people...","NULL"
"1905"," At the end of the day, it is the same, unless we were going to branch the code base, they're all working on the same code base, and they all need to be checked in and ready to go.","NULL"
"1906"," working on the same thing.","NULL"
"1907"," Do you know? I thought we were.","NULL"
"1908"," Because HTML5's website  . I guess .","NULL"
"1909"," I know it's going to get sticky when we start talking about  and functionality too.","NULL"
"1910"," You're saying it's a tradeoff, I guess. If we have to deal with the stories  , that's a lot easier issue than if we have .","NULL"
"1911"," You really have two pieces of the puzzle. Number one is resource allocation. I have a set of resources, and they need to be working on something  . How much they do, I wouldn't be able to predict what functionalities .","NULL"
"1912"," Then the second side of the coin is we have code, it's spread out across a lot of different modules, or locations for the location in TFS and  what they're working on.","NULL"
"1913","  they're separated TFS, judging by the same, what your asset is.","NULL"
"1914"," There is TFS. My point is that, from my experience, allocating somebody 60 percent to one thing and 40 percent to another thing doesn't allow you to develop a true velocity for your team, so you'll never know what your team is capable of.","NULL"
"1915"," We tried that a while ago, and it didn't go well. It was very difficult to say... Because some people on the teams were split like 60-40. Others were split 30-30-30-10. A majority of it was based on what the project managers felt at the time.","NULL"
"1916"," Our production went down because of all the context switches everybody had to do. We found it better to say, ""This team of six people is going to do one thing this iteration. You're going to do these stories this iteration. This team, you're going to do those stories.""","NULL"
"1917"," Usually those stories stay within the same context, so this one might be Conversations, this one might be Reports, this one might be  . That's just my experience.","NULL"
"1918"," It was my understanding that it would be the same code base so that we could do things intermittently. Is that not true anymore? That's what we had talked about.","NULL"
"1919"," When we're talking about HTML that's not the solution.","NULL"
"1920"," There are going to be two websites.","NULL"
"1921"," Is it?","NULL"
"1922"," I think so.","NULL"
"1923"," Why?","NULL"
"1924"," I thought it wasn't. I thought we were doing it as one, so if we had this contract management stuff that was using the HTML5, it could sit on top of whatever we've got now.","NULL"
"1925"," No, I would be violently opposed to that.","NULL"
"1926"," If you're running it on your phone.","NULL"
"1927"," Like mobile and  . I don't think that's a good idea.","NULL"
"1928"," Mobile  but the HTML version of it, because it's going to be incomplete. I just thought in order to be able to release, the functionality that we want to release without someone thinking that this is a new version  .","NULL"
"1929"," I see. Like,  , for example, was working on the new version of their website  specific version , whereas if you just went to www.  version two website. You're saying throw in a different sub-domain until it's ready for production...","NULL"
"1930"," Unless there's another way to say it's the version that's going to come up if you're running on  or something like that. What I thought was the very first release we put out there you're going to be able to run on your phone and you go to this website. If you go to this website you can access it on your phone or your iPad.","NULL"
"1931"," Do we want our users to do anything differently if they get to this on devices that are currently unsupported?","NULL"
"1932"," Not ultimately. I thought that's a way to, like I said, without saying there's two versions and they decide which one you want, I thought it was the best way to present it to our user base, to say, ""We have this mobile version of our website that you can access."" Ultimately it replaces them. If there's a way to do that seamlessly without them knowing any difference...","NULL"
"1933"," We can determine at will whether or not the users are in  versus  .","NULL"
"1934"," The thing I don't want to happen is I don't want them to say, ""Why is this? I lost my functionality."" I have to have a way for them to get to it. I want them to know consciously that they're getting a subset of functionality, and that's what you get on your iPad or on your phone.","NULL"
"1935"," Another thing that you can do, and I've seen this pattern used on  as well, is that when I was in the newer version, functionality wasn't complete, but there was a bar across the top that said, ""You're using a new version. If you'd like to go back to the older version that has all of these features, click on this link up there.""","NULL"
"1936"," I'm thinking, at least early on, in the first couple of releases, it would be more like if I'm on a phone or an iPad, and I go and it says, ""Function is not fully supported on this browser,"" so you're getting this subset domain.","NULL"
"1937"," Or, like I said, if they know ahead of time, we can just tell them, ""You can use it on your iPad which is limited  ."" I guess that's the way I envision it. We automatically detect...","NULL"
"1938"," But they wouldn't be able to go back to an older version on the Mac.","NULL"
"1939"," Yeah. Then the other thing we talked about a little bit and this is along the lines of what Darryl was thinking...","NULL"
"1940"," is as we add features, you basically launch it from the current website. If it's a new thing that we've done, you can go and it opens up a new HTML5 page on our current one, but you couldn't do that as a mobile thing.","NULL"
"1941"," Realistically, though, architecturally speaking, whether or not you wanted it on the website or the  ...","NULL"
"1942"," It's the same project.","NULL"
"1944"," All that, I'm going to figure out how, or that's just kind of the problem. I want to be able to release something without releasing it all.","NULL"
"1945"," Right.","NULL"
"1947"," For TFS, we can keep the Notify team, and then I can create...I've done this before, I have something called  , and then as those things are pushed into real iterations, I just move it over to that iteration, so we can keep all these stories in an HTML5 iteration.","NULL"
"1948"," However, that's not an iteration that's actually ever delivered. It gets put into the actual Notify iterations. Is that what you're saying?","NULL"
"1949"," If it's the same website, then obviously it's going to be the same release, and they're going to have to be able to get to them. If it's two different websites, then you could release one  . I think what you just said, we could work all those things out.","NULL"
"1950"," It should be easy enough to keep them separate. If there's a story that goes in that says, ""You may be able to login,"" obviously, someone's not going to...Something a little more is needed on the side conversations which is,  .","NULL"
"1951"," What are we looking at here? What is Trello?","NULL"
"1952"," Trello is a project manager app. It's on the Web. It really makes it easy to add stuff in a way that people can see your project, the whole thing. What we did is we made different columns for each of the epic stories. You've got a login page, home page, navigation, maps, conversations, reports, training, all those are epic stories.","NULL"
"1953"," Under each epic story, we have a sub-story and then some of those sub-stories might have sub-stories under them, and those are check boxes right now.","NULL"
"1954"," Where are you going to use  ?","NULL"
"1955"," This is like a temporary thing to  .","NULL"
"1956"," It's a lot easier to view everything, than TFS is. What we want to do is get the stories right on this, and then move them over to TFS so that there's less work in the long run.","NULL"
"1957"," I guess for this exercise today, these are the epics and we can start trying to put some high-level estimates on them. At the end of the day, we really want to know how long this whole project, to get this whole thing turned over is going to take, the high levels and then we can work out which ones we want to try and do first and scope out that work.","NULL"
"1958"," We know we've got two quarters to work with. We've got Mahesh here for at least two quarters. That's the expectation we've given them.","NULL"
"1959"," Starting in April?","NULL"
"1960"," It started today, really. That's what we said. Now that could be tomorrow, or the next day, but...The iteration, first iteration starts today.","NULL"
"1961"," OK. This 1.20, Release 1.20 that I have in there right now, has got to go out at the end of the month, so that's two weeks. I'm assuming, because that has all the stuff from  , the changes, and anything else, I have that being set up, for us to figure out how that goes out within those two weeks. I'm assuming none of this will be in that first two weeks.","NULL"
"1962"," Well, there might be some stuff coded that right now that's not checked into the database, it's all...I don't know where Mahesh...","NULL"
"1963"," If there's something simple enough that it's a testable thing, it's just not used in production as long as it's testable...","NULL"
"1964"," Yes.","NULL"
"1965"," at some level, that's fine, we can stick it in there.","NULL"
"1966"," Come April, we need everything checked into that code base, in the Notify code base now, here and more so, an emergency release going on in a couple of weeks. None of this stuff...","NULL"
"1967"," OK, so I don't have to worry about that right now.","NULL"
"1968"," Right. What we want to do is on a big level, make sure that we captured everything here, and then see if we can figure out a general full-scope, figure out what we want to do first. Then that will end up being the first iteration, and at the end of this iteration we'll see what Mahesh has  . We have our Agile classes to know what's good.","NULL"
"1969"," Right now, Karen and I have had a class, Brian's done it, so as far as that process is concerned that's where we stand on that.","NULL"
"1970"," Have we decided for searching or asset arrangement under something?","NULL"
"1971"," I think it's under Home page.","NULL"
"1972","  ?","NULL"
"1975","  .","NULL"
"1976"," Search assets is under Navigation.","NULL"
"1977"," Navigation is the bar on the top, so the thing that was already in there and then in the report we added  Navigation.","NULL"
"1978"," OK.","NULL"
"1979"," Then on the home page this basically  .","NULL"
"1980"," Joel, what approach do you want to take for this, or Joel, Baski, or both of you all, as far as do we want to just make sure first that we've got all the functionality that old Notify can do?","NULL"
"1981"," I want to do that. That's ultimately, you have to have that but I don't want it to actually be  . I want to go see a pole on a map. I don't want to say, ""Search, poles, ."" I want the map to be part of the application.","NULL"
"1982"," You go to the map, on that map, you show whatever you want and from there, you can do what you want. There still has to be a way to filter down to something. I'm not real sure how to group that together in the sense of, say if I have something like a list of contracts.","NULL"
"1983"," They don't really have anything to do with the map. I still want to be able to have an intuitive way to get to my list of contracts. I don't know what's the best approach to that from a user perspective.","NULL"
"1984"," What I do want, if something is mappable I want to go to that page that has a map on it and it'd be like  . I could sit there and filter, which becomes my search criteria. Searching for conversations, poles, conduit and these are the criteria I want to find and it just displays that stuff.","NULL"
"1985"," If I want to, say, use a list, it shows the grid. That all makes sense. Maybe that becomes just the list and the map is just insignificant in that. But all that stuff is similar to the way they have it but not like where you have to go tab, tab, tab, where you can see all that at one time and place. That's the difference. I don't know where is goes under the...","NULL"
"1986"," Can you add notes to these parts?","NULL"
"1987"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1988"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1990"," Stories.","NULL"
"1992"," You can add all that as notes, so maybe that user can search for assets on that individual location, and then you can work off of that, build your Balsamiq step flow out of that. Then we can create real usable stories on that. Because I don't know what the user stories are for that because you haven't designed it yet.","NULL"
"1993"," That's why we did an epic for Navigation, as opposed to just for Search.","NULL"
"1994"," Because there's two things there. There's searching mappable assets and there's searching just assets that have absolutely nothing ever to do with the map. That Search Asset needs to be broken out into two different things.","NULL"
"1995"," That's why I'm saying like the contracts or whatever it is. It's almost like I don't want it to be a different approach. We're still filtering it down to, if you just want a map or not, the map is there. A lot of the times, I guess when it is...","NULL"
"1996"," You have it broken down a little bit more inside there.","NULL"
"1997"," You could use the technique like a bounding technique to kill off the things that are going to take three years to do and say, ""I don't want to spend more than 50 points on this,"" or, ""I don't want to spend more than 20 points on that."" Whatever design you come up with, ultimately has to fall within those constraints.","NULL"
"1998"," I guess that's my big question on my mind. Do we go to this map page and see all these different components or do you go to an invoice page and you launch from there?","NULL"
"1999"," I think Darryl, your question, though, really is, ""Do you want all of the stories or epics defined today?"" We're not necessarily going to implement them all. We don't have to design them all right now but do we need to make sure all the functions are up here?","NULL"
"2000"," I just want to see if that's the best approach, to go through, make sure we've got all the functions covered and we know we want to also do this  functionality, so make sure that's covered. Brian, let me ask you this. Is it a standard practice that we would try to estimate all of these epics or is that even possible?","NULL"
"2001"," Or would it be better to just have something in mind and then break it down to prioritize it and start working it at according to level? At some point, I at least need to know, is this going to take six months or two years? But I don't want to spend forever on pie in the sky, how long is this going to take?","NULL"
"2002"," We're at a little bit of a disadvantage and at the same time, at a little bit of an advantage here because usually, when you have a project, somebody's throwing money at it and they want a particular piece of functionality.","NULL"
"2003"," That money's worth some amount of points. At that point, we say, ""I'm going to give you X number of points because you've given me X number of dollars."" We don't have that same philosophy here but we still know, you still intrinsically know, ""I don't want to spend any more than this amount of time on this particular functionality.""","NULL"
"2004"," At the high-level epic, I would still think that you can say, ""You've got 50 points this iteration to do whatever you think can be done."" If you need to break it out into epic one-stage one, epic two-stage two, that's still fine.","NULL"
"2005"," You still prioritize the highest priority ones up to epic one and say, ""You've got 50 points on this and whatever you've got has got to fit into that block. Otherwise it falls down and you've got to do it somewhere else."" That's what I recommend. We don't know exactly what this looks like but you've still got to rack and stack it.","NULL"
"2006"," Say, ""I'm going to give you 50 points on this epic. I'm going to give you 20 on this one. I'm going to give you 70 on that one."" That would at least let you progress through the first part of this and move on to more of the detailed design.

"2007"," I want to make sure that we've got things covered and then I would say, maybe, start trying to prioritize a bit, the things that we want to be able to accomplish.

"2013"," One thing that I think that home page probably needs to be either split up or...I guess what we need is a conversations home page. What we have today, the home page, is basically your conversations where you launch new conversations and open existing conversations. That's got things like, Reports that go on their own home page.","NULL"
"2014"," Has what?","NULL"
"2015"," It's based on Corey's design.  all these tiles and then it also says,  to customize your tiles, edit your tiles on that system but editing on a home page is basically just this and then I think it says something like, ""Save these conversations in a grid.""","NULL"
"2016"," The tile changes within the display window, so if you click on, ""My Conversations,"" it would be all the conversations that you're a part of, kind of like running a SafeSearch.","NULL"
"2017"," That's what Notify does today but then you also have the ability to open search. I found that to be  . I guess that's where I'm struggling with what the design's going to look like.","NULL"
"2018"," You can start at Search. You can have that be the first tile that's selected every time you login.","NULL"
"2019"," We don't have to get the detailed design for this right now.","NULL"
"2020"," I'm just trying to find a way that would be an epic  home page.","NULL"
"2021"," Yeah, that's not really an epic because it has a bunch of other stuff in it.","NULL"
"2022"," Like I said, I want all that to be integrated, on one page per se. I'd love for it to be like a map here and this is what you're seeing. Like, ""This is where I'm doing my work now."" If I want to do some adjustment to what's my data set, I want it to be  . Maybe it's like  and the search and it's just advanced, ""This is what I want to see.""","NULL"

"2029"," I know we said, ""Home page, basically that's where you're going to  ."" I think when we talked about that, how will that tie this together?","NULL"
"2030"," You want the home page to just be  ?","NULL"
"2031"," I guess it's like Zhivago, that website we were looking at. You go and you zoom, your home page, it's got a map in the background, it's got a place so you can say, turn on what you want to see.","NULL"
"2032","  .","NULL"
"2033"," To me that's like what...","NULL"
"2034"," Or like Zillow, you start by putting in an address. You come here and pick the context of, ""Buy,"" ""Rent,"" ""Sell,"" or, their estimating thing. Then you put in your address and click Search and it takes you to that area.","NULL"
"2035","  .","NULL"
"2036"," Either way, you can still have an epic of home page, or whatever. There's going to be a page when you logon that you go to. What's in that particular page might be different.","NULL"
"2037"," Zillow is probably the best example.","NULL"
"2038"," Is the name going to be that conversation  ? When someone logs on, here's my work and I can go from there and do my thing, I guess.","NULL"
"2039"," That's what we were doing with the tiles was that picks the context of what shows up in the main view area. Like you have here on the right, you've got things that you might be looking for. Instead of that we've got tiles of how you can change what's being searched for. If you only want to see the conversations that you're assigned to you click that tile. Then that's all that it displays.","NULL"
"2040"," That all lends itself to this Notify being conversation-centric. Is that your question? To continue it that way?","NULL"
"2041"," Right. But what I'm saying is that if when you login you're on the Search screen, instead of My Conversations you're on the Search screen, there's just a map there. Then you can add your search criteria from there. That's where you go to every time you login.","NULL"
"2042"," If you wanted to see My Conversations instead of that map all you have to do, instead of running your own search and doing that every time you're going to search...","NULL"
"2043"," Right. Then you just click the tile and that's what shows up in that viewing area.","NULL"
"2044"," Where does the epic for the map come in? Is that a subset of...?","NULL"
"2045"," Maybe it would just be under the Search. Although you're saying you want the Search to also just show the map side-by-side, like have a list view and then a map view?","NULL"
"2046"," The reason that we made the map that's on the epic is because there was a lot of pieces involved in just the map. There was drawing bounding area. There was adding search criteria. There was searching for different types of assets.","NULL"
"2047"," That can be fine. It may be under the area of the implications, just another area of the functionality.","NULL"
"2048"," Right. It's a part.","NULL"
"2049"," Here's an example of what I hope we can avoid. Today when you logon you've got your list of conversations. You can change that to say, ""My Conversations,"" ""Conversations assigned to me,"" use the same search and everything.","NULL"
"2050"," Open the conversation from there, but you can't just go search for conversations that you want and you can't go show those conversations on the map. If you want to do that you have to click Search, select Conversations, do your search, go all the way down and see that on the map, so it's duplicate functionality in two different places, neither of which has got everything you need to do.","NULL"
"2051"," There's a lot of crossover but what I want to avoid is...I'd almost rather have a Conversation page, and you can search and you can show the map, than have it the way it is today.","NULL"
"2052"," Do it all on one page.","NULL"
"2053"," Right. Maybe it's like you have your home page and you're doing it, or maybe you duplicate these for different things like for  and for conversations, and  .","NULL"
"2054"," What I was actually thinking of was home page, maybe Conversation home page. I don't know if that's worth doing or not but, like I said, I don't want to have duplicate areas of that.","NULL"
"2055"," Right. This gets rid of that because it's the same viewing area, so you would be able to see your conversations on the grid, and a map, and a calendar. If you have My Conversations selected, then you can do that with those conversations. Or, if you have Search selected, and you add search criteria, you get the same kind of list, map, and calendar options.","NULL"
"2056"," Basically, you're thinking of it being a way you set your criteria of what you're seeing and then you can save it as a tile. That's what this is.","NULL"
"2057"," Yes, exactly.","NULL"
"2058"," I guess we can shift that to develop things then to me, one of the first things you're going to do in this version is go down, logon and that gets you to the Conversation page, if you're on, let's say a mobile device and say, ""What do I want to see on here and...""","NULL"
"2059"," When you login on the mobile device all you see are the tiles. Once you click the tile that's when it brings up whatever you put it in. On a mobile device you can't have it to where you just logon and it  , you have to know what you're searching for.","NULL"
"2060"," When we have all that real estate then we can show the search area on a big map, and all that stuff, but we're dealing with such a small space we have to give them the choice when they logon of what they want to see next.","NULL"
"2061"," I just want to make sure, however we're set up for release, we have the ability to do it that way  .","NULL"
"2062"," You don't really have to have home page to think of it, ""This is the way we're going to organize the tiles and these things."" You're going to have Reporting, so that's an epic and whatever's involved in that. You have your Conversations and then whatever's involved in that. Maybe that's the way you should organize it. Like, ""Manage conversation,"" is your epic and however that's designed.","NULL"
"2063","  .","NULL"
"2064"," OK, well then maybe some of these things need to be moved over to the Conversations.","NULL"
"2065"," Yeah, I think so. I like...","NULL"
"2066"," You can get rid of this concept of this home page.","NULL"
"2067"," This whole concept needs to be managing joint use now. We need to start thinking of Notify as managing joint use and joint use relationships because that's what we want it to be. We need the personas...","NULL"
"2068"," It's managing assets and then actions. I think there's still going to be two.","NULL"
"2069"," Yeah, but you're still...","NULL"
"2070"," Then the asset  .","NULL"
"2071"," If you think about it from a mirror image perspective, it's like, ""Now I want to go and deal with my contracts."" Is that all? Then you've got to bring in some kind of navigation because you have to have the flow of how you get back to  and you'd put that under Navigation.","NULL"
"2072"," But you might have...","NULL"
"2073"," But Reports is in both.","NULL"
"2074"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2075"," Ideally, when we get mature in this whole process we're going to know our personas for everybody that's a user of this system and start from there. Right now, we've taken this Notify thing and we're going to try to redesign it and move some of the functionality in.","NULL"
"2076"," But when we start thinking of, ""80 percent of my users are attachers doing this. 70 of them are, or 10 percent of them are managers of joint use departments and pole owners and this is what they're going to want to do."" That's going to drive what...","NULL"
"2077"," Zillow you've got the buy, sell, rent, zestimate. You could literally almost come in and say, ""I'm an attacher.""","NULL"
"2078"," Or just know by...","NULL"
"2079"," The user tag what type of user you are.","NULL"
"2080"," We already have that knowledge. We have Notify for the most part for, what, seven, eight years? We have that knowledge. Why isn't that name they go by the same? We know Notify for a long time. We know all the software of Notify  .","NULL"
"2081"," I think we have to. I think his design does  , but I'm just not sure, like if I'm sitting here saying, ""We're going to work on this epic...""","NULL"
"2082"," He's just trying to organize the users' stories, not...","NULL"
"2083"," Is this going to allow us to come up with iterations that...?","NULL"
"2084"," The different swath of epics would be  . Not all of them would be by role. Not only would you have epics on both the slides but then you might have, underneath that, another swath of epics for that particular epic that you're breaking down by a particular role.","NULL"
"2085"," You might have a home page for the attacher versus a home page for the, give me some roles, asset manager versus contract manager versus...","NULL"
"2086"," If I was going to say, ""How are we going to do this, first?"" I would be of the mindset to say, ""I can do it with My Conversations. Forget the Contracts. List the Conversations, they're there."" I can logon. Somehow I can get my list of conversations I care about. I can open one of those conversations. Then I can see what I need to be doing. I can see that information.","NULL"
"2087"," Some of this lays out right here, but I guess maybe the epics might be, and I don't know if home page is the right word but at some point I want to manage my conversations. At some point I want to be able to manage my poles. At some point I want to be able to look at my conduit.","NULL"
"2088"," You want to manage a project, as well, for our internal people. That's completely different.","NULL"
"2089"," That's something that's maybe  not really there. In Notify it's there right now. But to me, managing a project is the combination of those conversations and assets. That's more of a, ""How do I take all of these assets I have and these things I have to do and reconcile those together?""","NULL"
"2090"," Maybe, for me, I might feel better if the epic was the conversations for the home page. Maybe just say an assets page.  and when I open the next asset, and the next asset, so I don't have to open up these things...","NULL"
"2091"," Basically, what you've done is you've pulled a list of these things, these conversations that you're managing. I can see where you should be able to search for them using your tools on the map and you should be able to save them using tools like your map, like a calendar and all those things, and dictate what subset of those conversations you want to see.","NULL"
"2092"," That's what you're sort of doing. I don't know that having them somewhere  falls into that same thing.","NULL"
"2093"," What's the Search at the top and the Search as a tile? That's confusing to me. What does that mean?","NULL"
"2094"," I think the navigation bar, that's always up there. On the level lines the tiles are going to move off the screen when you're on another page because they're not roving, so you have the bar up there so you can click it or  so you click it or  and get the tiles.","NULL"
"2095"," Yeah, you're not always going to get them on the home page with the conversations but if you go back to...","NULL"
"2096"," Search.","NULL"
"2098"," I don't think we're accomplishing much right now. I'm not sure where we're going.","NULL"
"2099"," It depends on what we really need to accomplish and what that is. I feel like we talked about, six months ago, ""What are the first things to do?""","NULL"
"2100"," That's right.","NULL"
"2101"," Yeah. I think the only thing we need to think about is...We've talked about the most valuable thing, I think, for Notify is going to be getting this JRM functionality in it. We know, if we're going to be selling this JRM, all these JRMs...","NULL"
"2102"," That's where things have somewhat changed a little bit. We know that's going to be very valuable. We also know we want to get this dashboard somehow integrated because that's proved to be very valuable. We just need to make sure that when we're doing this application now as HTML5...","NULL"
"2103"," If we went down the thought process of, ""Let's login. Now let me view My Conversations. Now let me add it,"" like we talked about before, we need to at least make sure that navigationally, when we're bringing in this JRM and dashboard functionality and stuff, we don't make that ancillary to doing a conversation and, ""Now we're doing this management,"" and it's off to the side.","NULL"
"2104"," I think we need to think of it as, ""I'm a user. This is what I'm trying to do."" I agree with you that that might still be the very first thing we do, we just need to think about, ""I'm Maggie and I might be doing this and this. Right now all I can do is open my conversation but in six months I'm going to be managing JRMs, so am I going to completely change home screens, now?"" That's all.","NULL"
"2105"," Let me just put this back  . The one thing that's holding me back from going down this one path we're about to go down is the fact that we might want to see two things, right?","NULL"
"2106"," Conduit and  . What do we think about that? We think about what we're going to do is right now you can go in there and say, ""You go to the Search screen. That gives you a list of everything you can possibly want to look at."" I can go to a checkbox and choose. Basically, this home page, there is a home page for each thing that we want to manage.","NULL"
"2107"," That would be a little bit along the lines of the JRMs. The thing right here is good but let's just say you're saying, ""Conversations."" If your tiles maybe say, ""Searches,"" and your other thing is, ""Create a new one,"" something like that, then you may go to a similar home page for poles, which has the exact same layout but you're talking about poles instead of conversations.","NULL"
"2108"," I think, at some point, particularly when we get to the map and  the map if it makes sense to let's say it may have additional things that you could view as reference. That can be something that we put on a back burner.","NULL"
"2109"," You can think about that home page epic. There's one of those per each thing. I think we did get into a little bit of trouble because there's a lot of things we can't do on a conversation page that tries to stay open and generic.","NULL"
"2110"," We can't search for a conversation that has an attachment on it that belongs to this company because we're trying to do something generic. It's an easy query but we  do something  .","NULL"
"2111"," We can at least leave ourselves the ability to do some very specific things on that  . That way we could easily start out with Conversations and we could have a parallel path to look at the same thing for contracts because we have  contracts.","NULL"
"2112"," That would lend itself to being more like JRM where, say you're home, you login and you go to a home page that right now it's all linked but you've got a home page that has everything that you can do. You've got assets, billing, reference data...","NULL"
"2113"," People like that.","NULL"
"2114"," workflow, with everything underneath it. You click on Poles and then you've got your links to all the things you can do on the poles.","NULL"
"2115"," If there's a person that only has Notify for joint use, or whatever...","NULL"
"2116"," Then you could just take them there. They go directly to the conversation.","NULL"
"2117"," they go directly to the landing spot or whatever.","NULL"
"2118"," People did say, up in class,  they really like the organization of JRM. It's very easy to know exactly what you're doing and go into it because of the way that home page is done.","NULL"
"2119"," That's fine.","NULL"
"2120"," That makes it a little...","NULL"
"2121"," It's not far off from what we have right here. The thing is the map is going to be integrated into that page, at least when you're on a desktop situation.","NULL"
"2122"," Out of curiosity, where is it that I see the map?","NULL"
"2123"," We don't show it here.","NULL"
"2124"," Where the grid is right now.","NULL"
"2125"," It would be right here.","NULL"
"2126"," It would be where the grid is right now.","NULL"
"2127"," The way I would see some of these things is if you think about a Web page you can move, it can collapse the search criteria, or you can collapse your saved searches. You can bring down the list versus the map.","NULL"
"2128"," Just like the home search sites where you'd start on the map and then you can add criteria to it to narrow your search down. If you only want to see single family homes, or condos, you can filter that out. That would be like poles or...","NULL"
"2129"," Everything that would be searchable in here would be similar to a search-based scenario where if you're doing poles, or you bring up a house or I can filter it down. I can see the list. I can see the map and it's just going to  .","NULL"
"2130"," The big difference to me that would be a little bit more like year-end is if somebody wants to go search for poles, they don't click Search and then, say, ""Look for poles."" They'd be like, ""I'm going to poles.""","NULL"
"2131"," I'm going to the poles site.","NULL"
"2133"," Yeah, I like that.","NULL"
"2134"," As opposed to going Search, select that, put it in your criteria, then click the tab, and it shows you the map.","NULL"
"2135"," Sometimes, you don't have to put criteria in. You can just go right to the map. That was confusing in my class in Connecticut to them.","NULL"
"2136"," If there's just something I want, I can click on it.","NULL"
"2137"," The functionality is there.","NULL"
"2138"," If you've got the tab functionality other than the Conversation.","NULL"
"2139"," The functionality is there. The user experience is not the same. For us, it's fine because we know.","NULL"
"2140"," Yeah, we've done it forever.","NULL"
"2141"," But there's still certain things you have to know before I click Search, and go to the map, and then it incorporates that. That's the thing we're trying to solve, so if you want to just change that epic  .","NULL"
"2142"," Conversation  ?","NULL"
"2143"," We'll do it specific conversations  because then it's  . We want it to be really in the next iteration...","NULL"
"2144"," I like that. Now we've got all of this. Is what is in here all the Notify current functionality?","NULL"
"2145"," Yes.","NULL"
"2146"," That's what's here?","NULL"
"2147"," Mm-hmm.","NULL"
"2148"," What we need then, is, we need specific things with dashboard, sharing functionality, and managing projects.","NULL"
"2149"," Is the dashboard Baski's dashboard integrating that into Notify? Is that what that is?","NULL"
"2150"," I think so. Baski, you can speak up if that's...","NULL"

"2155"," If you do it similarly to the way you did the map and the grid, you just design, ""This is the way I want to see the data,"" so you could build it in to where it's behind the scenes for the data source. But I think also you can do a non-specific, because we know the Conversation...","NULL"

"2160"," That's all.","NULL"
"2161"," Scroll down on your conversation home page, a generic search. What does that mean?","NULL"
"2162"," Generic search for a conversation. It was generic because there were other searches on that list, but...","NULL"
"2163"," I would call that basically, ""You can filter your results,"" because you know you're there, you're there in the conversation.","NULL"
"2164"," Hit, ""Filter results,"" that's probably a good way to do it. Just, ""Filter results,"" you don't need the ""search"" in there.","NULL"
"2165"," Those things are basically just some kind of saved searches. From a user story...","NULL"
"2166"," When we create the stories, we could put that under, ""User can filter the results,"" and these are some examples inside that Filter Results.","NULL"
"2167"," That's a good example of user story that reminds me again of SafeSearch.","NULL"
"2168"," Yeah, because we can't see the recently changed things, so that's new, which they've asked for a long time.","NULL"
"2169"," I would say, for as far as what we're doing today, I can have Jasmine get with Baski and Joel or something, and get some dashboard stories and make an epic for the dashboard and when you get with me, we'll make some stories on a JRM functionality. Joel's got some ideas on that.","NULL"

"2182"," Going back to the previous experience again, having two different swaths of stories, one for  and one for  , is just a really bad idea, because you can't test all of that until the very end when  is done, and when UI is done.

"2183"," But what we can do, given this current situation, we could have a pre-iteration type thing. Where this is a design iteration, or a design two iterations, but it's relatively usable, I mean it's usable stuff that they're doing, in lieu of...","NULL"

This is mock data and this is what we've been working on."" That's still less expensive than doing a total rewrite at the end when you realize, that ""Hey, this is not what I wanted. This is not what I signed up for.""","NULL"
"2186"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2187"," Mock data probably is a really good tool.","NULL"

"2190"," Better sooner rather than later.","NULL"

"2192"," Yeah, if it can at least do that right now.","NULL"
"2193"," Or if it can pull up what's assigned to me.","NULL"
"2194"," Let's estimate that from both sides, from whatever Baski needs to do, whatever Mahesh is going to...","NULL"
"2195"," Is there anything wrong with that being the user story, ""I can login and see a list of My Conversations""?","NULL"
"2196"," I think I can login is one page. I can go to the website, be presented with a login page and then provide my credentials.","NULL"
"2197"," OK, is one story.","NULL"
"2198"," You can very well have an acceptance criteria that says, ""When I login I'm redirected to a page that shows me what stuff is assigned to me."" That's perfectly valid.","NULL"
"2199","  .","NULL"
"2201"," Yeah, work together, right.","NULL"
"2202"," It could be dummy data until that's done, but that's perfectly legitimate.","NULL"
"2203"," That you're presented with a login screen is valid, too, but then, what happens after you get in...?","NULL"
"2204"," into it. Something with  .","NULL"
"2205"," That way, I can create a test case for it, and give to someone...","NULL"
"2206"," that if you login and it says, ""Notify page coming,"" at least you've logged in. ","NULL"
"2207"," There's nothing wrong with that.","NULL"
"2208"," Then, once we have that, then you can start with testing the website, ""I want to be able to register,"" and that's all for a different path and it's so easy to get  .","NULL"
"2209"," I can't do it, but...","NULL"
"2210"," That give us...This is the best way I can think of to...","NULL"
"2211"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2212"," I don't want to end up doing all these great pieces and then  .","NULL"
"2213"," That's why I like epics. I look at all of these bullets that are underneath that and really, the stories that go underneath an epic are the acceptance criteria for the epic.","NULL"
"2214"," There's nothing prohibiting anybody from creating a top-level epic that says, ""Release 1.0Then nest all your epics underneath that and maybe have an even higher level epic on the conversation home page where it just says, ""Epic home page,"" which has all the epics for all the different types of home pages that we have, conversation, reporting, whatever you want to say.","NULL"
"2215"," There's nothing prohibiting that. Then, even having the dashboard underneath the epic conversation home page, where there's an epic conversation dashboard, there's nothing prohibiting that. Again, it allows it to roll it up to where the epic has acceptance criteria, because all of these are acceptance criteria on each of the epics.","NULL"
"2216"," It's up to whoever's flushing the story out to determine whether or not they want to create stories for that, because even the stories can become epics if you break those down. Nothing prohibiting that.","NULL"
"2217"," We need to try our best to come up with a list of doable work/stories for this iteration, and then maybe between us meeting together a few times, some of us in the next two weeks while that's being worked, try to start coming up with a good backlog of stuff so that we're not sitting here each time trying to come up with  what we need to do.","NULL"
"2218"," In the Agile classes, we're always taught the user story, ""As a something-something user, I can do this,"" and we'll have a task that needs to be done to accomplish that as far as the development tasks go.","NULL"
"2219"," Correct, but, a project manager or ScrumMaster or a product owner think the whole notion of an epic is a set of related user stories. We haven't gone to users and said, ""Hey, what do you want this to do?"" If we did, this would be a lot more trivial.","NULL"
"2220"," I know, it's hard.","NULL"
"2221"," What we have now is what we think is the problem with our existing application, and what we think is the right solution for it.","NULL"
"2222"," We're attacking it from the opposite side. We're attacking it from the top down instead of the bottom up. Now I've got a placeholder for blah, and I need it to do blah really, really well, but I don't know what blah looks like yet.","NULL"
"2223"," This is again, going back to release planning. All of that, if we do it the right way, will be laid out ahead of time, so when we come in here, we're not talking about, ""What stories are we missing?"" We're talking about, ""What needs to go into release one? What needs to go in relation to release whatever?"" We've got to get to that point.","NULL"
"2224"," Right now, not only does Baski have the Fast Path stuff, but then this Friday we got put on us that we have to do this other being able to logon and  through the Notify. You don't know about any of this, Karen, but the map...","NULL"
"2225"," the MapPoint, get rid of MapPoint...","NULL"
"2226"," Get rid of MapPoint.","NULL"
"2227"," and all of that. Baski said he would need to do that.","NULL"
"2228"," the Notify stuff. At any rate, we have limited...We have deadlines for things, but we have Mahesh here. I really want to know from Baski what direction should we take as far as the next two weeks?","NULL"
"2229","  with the data.  Notify.","NULL"
"2230"," We've got what they've got for mock up.","NULL"
"2231"," I know.  .","NULL"
"2232"," In two weeks we've got a URL, and you logon, and it checks your credentials through the Notify test, whatever, database, and he's got that home page with that data behind it.","NULL"
"2233","  .","NULL"
"2234"," Male Participant? Are we going to say we're going to have the three  ?","NULL"
"2235"," Yeah,  .","NULL"
"2236"," Three what?","NULL"
"2237"," Three devices, phone, tablet...","NULL"
"2238"," OK, got you.","NULL"
"2239"," Phone, tablet, tablet.","NULL"
"2240"," Phone, tablet, tablet, right. ","NULL"
"2241"," Mahesh, can you estimate doing that? ","NULL"
"2242"," The user story, ""You can login with a tablet, you can login with a phone, and you can login with your PC""?","NULL"
"2243"," Yes.","NULL"
"2244"," Those are the acceptance criteria.","NULL"
"2245"," Those are going to be the sort of constants. Because that can be responsibly done and basically says, ""That's it.""","NULL"
"2246"," I would love to actually really create test cases  supposed to be doing that so that those are in there all the time.","NULL"
"2247"," If we keep it all together, we keep Baski's stories that we're working on, the other five stories that we're working on in this iteration...","NULL"
"2248"," Yeah, if that could be done in the two weeks, then they could all be in 1.20.","NULL"
"2249"," 2.0Female Participant:  Oh, you want to change the release?","NULL"
"2250"," I think if the release is...","NULL"
"2251"," She's saying you can include it in 1.20 without...We're not releasing any of this to the public in 2.0Female Participant:  Right.","NULL"
"2252"," No. No, we're not.","NULL"
"2253"," But they'll be in there.","NULL"
"2254"," It can be released without anybody knowing it's there.","NULL"
"2255"," As 1.20, because I have bug fixes in there.","NULL"
"2256"," Yeah. That's fine. I was just saying, as we start this thing...","NULL"
"2257"," What's being worked on then right now?","NULL"
"2258"," we should change it to 2.0Male Participant:  What's being worked on then?","NULL"
"2259"," The two stories you did before I left, that weren't released for production yet.","NULL"
"2260"," All that's been built.","NULL"
"2261"," That's been built and is ready to go, it just hasn't been released to production yet. I've got to look at the permitting thing on the conduit.","NULL"
"2262"," The question is, ""Is it going to be rebuilt?""","NULL"
"2263"," Yes, we'll need a rebuild.","NULL"
"2264"," What's being changed?","NULL"
"2265"," What's in there right now, what's going to be changed?","NULL"
"2266"," What you used in training, everything, as far as I know, works that's there already. I just have to put it in production.","NULL"
"2267"," Right. But there are some other things that came up that I need to talk to you all about, which is in...Did I schedule that meeting yet? I don't know that I did yet. There are some other things that might need to be changed in the next two weeks. I don't know.","NULL"
"2268"," If we do this, what we're talking about, it shouldn't impact anything that's in existing production. If it's a different URL, then we know  URL.","NULL"
"2269"," Will there be something that I can test under that bit, whatever is going to be developed?","NULL"
"2270"," Test what?","NULL"
"2271"," The login.","NULL"
"2272"," She doesn't want something checked in, we deploy the current Notify, and we've screwed something up. That's all she's worried about.","NULL"
"2273"," I already told her this. We are not touching anything code wise, without  needs to be doing.","NULL"
"2274"," It's not going to be the same URL for this.","NULL"
"2275"," It's a different URL. After the case is opened up, that's it. There's nothing going to change the current Notify functionality. Nothing. You just login, often because we have to check into Notify, that's it. Other than that, it's not going to be anything more on Notify. You're not going to affect any process and applications.","NULL"
"2276"," But if I'm still putting it under that TFS case is it something I'm going to be able to test within the next two weeks?","NULL"
"2277"," Yeah. That's what we said. We're going to do it and within two weeks. Of course, we haven't let him answer the question yet of his estimate price. We're assuming that we will be able to.","NULL"
"2278"," I'll make sure that you know exactly what to do. How about that? That way when you guys want, you can test this new functionality. No confusion.","NULL"
"2279"," Can you do that?","NULL"
"2280"," Yes.","NULL"
"2281","  Mahesh?","NULL"
"2282"," I don't have  .","NULL"
"2283"," Which page?","NULL"
"2284"," We don't have any login mock ups at all. He's just doing a page.","NULL"
"2285"," We need it.","NULL"
"2286"," You have the app for mobile.","NULL"
"2287"," and then he can mock up something.","NULL"
"2288"," Big happy face if they login. Big sad face if they can't do it.","NULL"
"2289"," Give them two fingers if it's successful, and one finger if it's not.","NULL"
"2290"," Make sure it's the middle finger.","NULL"
"2291"," That's a user experience, isn't it?","NULL"
"2292"," Can we make it like a blue screen of death?","NULL"
"2293"," OK, so Corey's got to mock that up. What about that conversation on the page that you've been working on?","NULL"
"2294","  release.","NULL"
"2295"," But you've been working on it.","NULL"
"2296"," We started this one.","NULL"
"2297"," Is that an open conversation, or is that a list of conversations, is it one single?","NULL"
"2298"," We will provide the front page with conversations.","NULL"
"2299"," The front page with a list?","NULL"
"2300"," Yes.","NULL"
"2302"," That's what we'll do. We login. We land on some page that shows a list of conversations.","NULL"
"2303"," That still bothers me, having to do  .","NULL"
"2304","  .","NULL"
"2305"," Is that responsive design right now where it's...?","NULL"
"2306"," Yeah, it's responsive.","NULL"
"2307","  . I'm going to use the same thing we had on the other page. I need to remove .","NULL"
"2308"," Within two weeks...? Do you have an estimate for doing that without having any data hooked up behind it?","NULL"
"2309"," Yeah, we don't need to do that again. Basically change.","NULL"
"2310"," Then, once Corey gets that login mocked up, we'll see if we can get all that.","NULL"
"2311"," Two weeks is the 25th, are we saying? We're counting today, or not counting today?","NULL"
"2312"," Stating today.","NULL"
"2313"," I'd say two weeks again, a full two weeks.","NULL"
"2314"," I might be off one week. I didn't decide which week.","NULL"
"2315"," In this two weeks? OK. ","NULL"
"2316"," Your login was not successful.","NULL"
"2317"," You have two remaining attempts.","NULL"
"2318"," Be careful. We're recording now.","NULL"
"2319"," What was that Jim Carey thing where he plays the  ?","NULL"
"2320","  .","NULL"
"2321"," Do we want to put any other stories in there?","NULL"
"2322"," Let's branch off. I would say, maybe we can...","NULL"
"2323"," Open a given single conversation?","NULL"
"2324"," Yeah, we'll get that story and Karen can create a story. I'm sure Jasmine can help create stories.","NULL"
"2325"," After that, then you can do that under that epic conversation story. We've got a pretty decent list of things that will just be  .","NULL"
"2326"," Yeah. We'll do that. I will try to come up with...","NULL"
"2327"," action. I can see the entities, I can see the contacts. I can sign in. Although there should be stories listed under there.","NULL"
"2328"," I'm going to try to come up with JRM stories.","NULL"
"2329"," The epics costs.","NULL"
"2330"," The problem is, TFS...","NULL"
"2331"," I've got much better ideas after this conversation.","NULL"
"2332"," support for epics sucks. Because we can't do this with TFS 2012. We can do this a little bit better with 2013, but we have multi-level epics and we can't do it with TFS.","NULL"
"2333"," Should I have her not even create the epic in TFS, just do the user story?","NULL"
"2334"," Probably just user stories.","NULL"
"2335"," We could use this and it's free, so we could use this for having epics stuff.","NULL"
"2336"," As long as we stick with one. I don't want some person creating on Google Docs, somebody's creating on this, somebody's creating on that.","NULL"
"2337"," We'll use TFS as the actual user stories, just for organizing it's fine.","NULL"
"2338"," Yeah, as long as everybody uses this, maybe not different ways  .","NULL"
"2339"," This is more, if you want to go and look at all of the epics.","NULL"
"2340"," Well, the 2013 has got an epic work board that looks exactly like this.","NULL"
"2341"," All right. I'm going to try to come up with JRM stories. Joel, I think, maybe the assignment stories. Managing project, I'll send those to Jasmine. Corey's going to create the mock up for the logon page.","NULL"
"2342"," Desktop, tablet, and mobile.","NULL"
"2343"," The hash key's working on that? Baski's going to...Baski or Brian, or both.","NULL"
"2344"," Those things for assignments  .","NULL"
"2345"," Either way we'll need user stories for the single file version. Even if it's just like this. Then, I guess, we will meet tomorrow to go over the Fast Path stuff.","NULL"
"2346"," When you set up a date  report for Fast Path.","NULL"
"2347"," What are you saying, ""Fast pass,"" or...?","NULL"
"2348"," Fast Path.","NULL"
"2349"," Fast Path.","NULL"
"2350"," Fast Path.","NULL"
"2351"," Fast Path. Bold. Bold.","NULL"
"2352"," F-A-S-T, space, P-A-T-H. That's just a name that Eversource uses for some reason.","NULL"
"2353"," I keep hearing Disney. I don't know why. Disney Fast Pass.","NULL"
"2354","  Fast Path. Path. Like a walkway, pathway.","NULL"
"2355"," That's just what they called it. They wanted a fast path to...","NULL"
"2356"," It's a bulk edit.","NULL"
"2357"," It's a, ""Don't make me click here, here, here, here and here to enter the thing I do all the time.""","NULL"
"2358"," Enter Corey. ","NULL"
"2359"," When I do it 500 times. That's what it is.","NULL"
"2360"," Only me and you, and Des and Anne are in that. I don't have anybody else here in on that meeting.","NULL"
"2361"," Does it have any non-budget  ?","NULL"
"2362"," Have you decided  ?","NULL"
"2363"," I don't have a good answer from them.","NULL"
"2364"," Des was sick on Friday, so Karen never got to ask her.","NULL"
"2365"," Des still  .","NULL"
"2366"," They were good.","NULL"
"2367"," I want them to understand what the options are...","NULL"
"2368"," and for us to come up with...It shouldn't be a real long meeting, but just come up with the direction is what the purpose of it is.","NULL"
"2369"," Just to say, ""This is what we're doing,"" and then build from there, unless you...","NULL"
"2370"," His preference is another app. That's not my preference.","NULL"
"2371"," His preference is what?","NULL"
"2372"," His preference is a Web app.","NULL"
"2373"," Windows app.","NULL"
"2374"," Windows app. My preference is an import-export inside Notify thing.","NULL"
"2375"," I mean, Baski's right. If it needs to be, if we need to provide dropdowns and things, that's very helpful.","NULL"
"2376"," That may make it much, much better for them.","NULL"
"2377"," I'm perfectly fine with that. I just don't want to force someone to go get another tool now. If that's where their direction is, then that's perfectly fine with me. If it makes the most sense for us.","NULL"
"2378"," Best of both worlds is, Baski can do that within Notify, not a Windows app. Did you ever look at that, Baski?","NULL"
"2379"," I looked at the  , I didn't get a chance to explore.","NULL"
"2380"," That's the best of both worlds.","NULL"
"2381"," Yeah. That would be the best of both worlds in there.","NULL"
"2382"," We decided Baski was going to see if that was possible  . ","NULL"
"2383"," The first implementation of this would be the print people entering the survey stuff, because that's where  came up with. Those are their engineers. Eversource engineers and Frontier engineers. Frontier is the ones that were complaining, like, ""No, heck, I'm not using Notify, because it sucks.""","NULL"
"2384"," All they do this complain and complain. It's like, ""Stop.""","NULL"
"2385"," But the problem was Frontier's not going to do it for whatever reason. Eversource was forced to do it for them. They don't have the capacity to keep doing, click here, click here, click here, click here. Eversource would ideally want Frontier to do their own surveys.","NULL"
"2386"," Both need to be able to do it quickly and efficiently, because they both have surveys to do.","NULL"
"2387"," The engineers take it to the field?","NULL"
"2388"," Ideally that would be great. I don't know that that's a necessarily a requirement right now. That's what I'm getting from them.","NULL"
"2389"," Anybody can leave.","NULL"
"2390"," Anything we could take to the field to me would be more important. This is the problem, if Frontier refuses to do it still, they're going to have to do it desktop. That would be the most likely...","NULL"
"2391"," so that we can coordinate?","NULL"
"2392"," I think Daryl needs to prioritize it first because it sounds like we already have two projects going on concurrently. We need to focus.","NULL"
"2393"," I know. Let me see if I can conference you, I'm going to put you on hold.","NULL"
"2394"," OK.","NULL"
"2395"," Thanks.","NULL"
"2397"," Hey  . Hello.","NULL"
"2398"," I need to try and conference you in with Brian.","NULL"
"2399"," I just wanted to let you know I've got to...I don't know if I'm going to be able to stay on here because I've got to go up to the warehouse.","NULL"
"2400"," OK.","NULL"
"2401","  away.","NULL"
"2402"," In that case, if you want to just hang out, I'll just tell him that you're not available for the call today.","NULL"
"2403"," OK, that's fine, that would be perfect because I won't be. I'll get back on a little bit later.","NULL"
"2404"," OK, sounds good, thanks.","NULL"
"2405"," Alright, thank you.","NULL"
"2406"," Bye.","NULL"
"2407"," Bye-bye.","NULL"
"2408"," Did I scare him away?","NULL"
"2409"," Hey, Brian.","NULL"
"2410"," I'm here.","NULL"
"2411"," Kaylow, actually, he called to tell me that he needs to not be on the call.  I was like, ""Good, I don't need to figure how to conference."" You think before I even have a kick-off meeting that I need to get with Daryl to get clarity on what project we're doing?","NULL"
"2412"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2413"," OK. I can do that. I just got a call yesterday from Matt, asking me about the Mobile Collect. I'm like, ""I can't tell you anything about it."" It's a Frontier, I haven't even had the chance to look at it. I'll try to look at it today.","NULL"
"2414"," All right, I'll do that then, before I try and schedule something. It's 9:21. I'm bringing up what we have. Do we still have testing the CTDI? Did they send something else yesterday?","NULL"
"2415"," Mm-hmm, they sent one before.","NULL"
"2416"," The last thing that they sent, you said, ""Yeah, we got them all, and they're all good."" We can probably close this, because I don't imagine I'm going to do any more testing today.","NULL"
"2417"," That's your call.","NULL"
"2418"," We're going to be closing up good tonight.","NULL"
"2419"," If they want, send something else. They probably check it, it should be in SELECT statement, but what was sent looked good, and maybe...The work closed, worked. ","NULL"
"2420"," OK. Then I will just fail to test-run test this. Brian, do you have anything that we need to talk to them about on the call today?","NULL"
"2421"," Probably, but I don't know yet.","NULL"
"2422"," ","NULL"
"2423"," Because it probably won't be on this morning's call, but I'm about to start working on the work orders. I don't have blanket project information that I can tell or estimates for this stuff, so I'm sure that's going to get in the way. I'm not quite sure how they're going to want to handle that. I need to dig into this a little more so I can more appropriately formulate a question for them.","NULL"
"2424"," OK, so where are we at with the rest of their fallout in general? Do you know?","NULL"
"2425"," I have about 20, 30 million assets, about 231 are falling out.","NULL"
"2426"," That's not bad.","NULL"
"2427"," No, and that's because there's one particular FRC, never seen before .17 records have that on there and then the rest are bad catalog references. I think we've got all. None of the catalog information is falling out. There's only one location that's falling out and that's because the three character one doesn't have any assets on, so it doesn't affect anything.","NULL"
"2428"," OK, yeah, they said they were going to leave that alone anyway.","NULL"
"2429"," Yeah, and then the other point looks to be that the...crap, I was going somewhere.","NULL"
"2430"," ","NULL"
"2431"," That tripped me off.","NULL"
"2432","  .","NULL"
"2433"," Yeah, and I don't even touch that partly, so there's still that whole falling out there. I'm trying to get at least to the point where they're functional business wise so I need to get the work orders in there. I think ship orders escaped my...I was looking at the publish package for this version, and I noticed that I was publishing ship orders before and I'm not even importing those now.","NULL"
"2434"," I didn't even consider ship orders, so I'm going to have to see if I can pull that information in at some point either today or early tomorrow too. As far as fallout is concerned, it's looking pretty good this time around and they're actually letting me make generic rules that prevent stuff from falling out.","NULL"
"2435"," OK. That's good. Maybe the next time we do this for somebody, we should give them trial run to show them they're going to get, so that then they understand what we mean by ""Fallout.""","NULL"
"2436"," I think the next time we do this, I'm not going to do it.","NULL"
"2437"," I know. ","NULL"
"2438"," We need to give them the schema to ETR catalog extension after there's commitment, and so they take...you give us your data and you put in this format and then roll.","F"
"2439"," ","NULL"
"2440"," Kim imported the database to Mary.","NULL"
"2441"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2442"," Do you have any questions on the users? I know you all send some emails back and forth. Think you're good now?","NULL"
"2443"," I think I'm good. I was here until about eight o'clock last night, getting all the date array. I had it parsed through the names to separate the first class and from the initial GET.","NULL"
"2444"," Just basically getting it towards ready to go in the user's tail log. I've got to delete one user from the script though, because he's already in the user's table. Ken Howard, he was already in the user table, but he's also in this spreadsheet.","F"
"2445"," We might want to just ask him about that, because that's weird. If he's a Verizon employee, then he would already be in Frontier's user tables. Do you think it's worth asking him? That's just weird.","NULL"
"2446"," That is weird.","NULL"
"2447"," I'll gather the info and send you all the email and go from there.","NULL"
"2448"," OK. I just want to make sure there's nothing else that we need to be concerned about.","NULL"
"2449"," He's the only user out of the 3,373  that's already in the user's table, and his user roll's already set up, too.","NULL"
"2450"," You're planning on importing that, when?","NULL"
"2451"," I can do it, whenever. I'm ready. I just have to know what to do about to him.","NULL"
"2452"," I would think you would do that tomorrow, right before we back up the database?","NULL"
"2453"," OK.","NULL"
"2454"," Backing up the database, our test or their test, do you remember?","NULL"
"2455"," Ours.","NULL"
"2456"," Of course.","NULL"
"2457"," Yeah, OK. I don't know if that was something...","NULL"
"2458"," I'll get an SQL to him, to put them all in and set their user rolls.","NULL"
"2459"," You can do that maybe when you're doing this. Stop the work, close the interfaces running the scripts for 1.1. Were you going to do the production backup or was Brian? I didn't put names, I just put...","NULL"
"2460"," What was the question? I couldn't hear it.","NULL"
"2461"," Sorry.","NULL"
"2463"," I didn't know if Grady was going to do that, or if you were planning on doing that, Brian.","NULL"
"2464"," It doesn't matter. If you guys are doing it tomorrow, then Grady's probably going to be the better person, because I'm going to be calling it early tomorrow afternoon, I'll be out to  .","NULL"
"2465"," You probably had already danced.","NULL"
"2466"," Yep.","NULL"
"2467"," Oh yeah, I forgot about that. We can't really start it until eight o'clock anyway, based on our stop timeline event, which isn't until seven. Grady, you might want to take half the day off tomorrow, since you're going to be working half the night. ","NULL"
"2468"," I'll decide to come in later tomorrow.","NULL"
"2469"," Maybe work from home in the morning and then take the afternoon off and then work for the whole night.  Whatever you want to do. Doesn't matter to me, because you're the one that has to work.","NULL"
"2470"," Anything special we have to do on backing up or just follow my gut with the interface?","NULL"
"2471"," Right-click, back up, and then I'd probably make sure that you don't back up to a backup file that already exists, you probably want to do that. The backup shouldn't take long, but you'll probably want to 7-zip it.","NULL"
"2472"," Like I did last time?","NULL"
"2473"," Yeah. That will take probably half-hour or an hour to do that. Then you'll probably want to open up Internet Explorer and then go to the FTP site. From the Internet Explorer, tell it to open it up in Windows Explorer, and then copy it to the FTP site that way. I've had really good luck of low latency and quick copies doing it...copying file like that.","NULL"
"2474"," We'll get to back it up 7-ZIT, and put it on our FTP site.","NULL"
"2475"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2476"," Will you pull it down from there and restore it when you get ready to start?","NULL"
"2477"," Yes.","NULL"
"2478"," OK, so he goes to step five, and then you'll restore it when you get ready.","NULL"
"2479"," You might want to put names to these, so I can know who's doing what.","NULL"
"2480"," Yeah, I can do that. OK, I got to hang up and call in, it's 9:30.","NULL"
"2481"," OK.","NULL"
"2482"," Nice.","NULL"
"2483"," Call you.","NULL"
"2484"," Bye.","NULL"
"2485"," Bye.","NULL"
"2486"," Hi, who's on the call?","NULL"
"2487"," Violet.","NULL"
"2488"," Good morning, it's Kim.","NULL"
"2489"," Hey Violet, hey Kim.","NULL"
"2490"," Brian's on.","NULL"
"2491"," Hey Brian. Anybody else on the call?","NULL"
"2492"," Might be a quick call this morning. I don't think we have anything for you guys. Do you all have anything we need to talk about?","NULL"
"2493"," Hi, who joined?","NULL"
"2494"," Hi, it's DJ.","NULL"
"2495"," Hey DJ.","NULL"
"2496"," We don't have anything for you guys. Do you all have anything for us?","NULL"
"2497"," Did Jim join?","NULL"
"2498"," He did not.","NULL"
"2499"," OK, he's on a CTDI call which...Apparently, he wanted me to talk to you guys about...it may be a table field model, and then its DISTOCD, it's in regard to warehousing  warehouses. Brian, he's saying that we either need a copy of that data or if there's a place in LCAM to store it. I'll send that to you via email, but apparently, he just wanted me to bring that up.","F"
"2499"," OK, he's on a CTDI call which...Apparently, he wanted me to talk to you guys about...it may be a table field model, and then its DISTOCD, it's in regard to warehousing  warehouses. Brian, he's saying that we either need a copy of that data or if there's a place in LCAM to store it. I'll send that to you via email, but apparently, he just wanted me to bring that up.","A"
"2502"," OK. Oh, this is the COET data, OK. All right, I'll definitely check into that.","NULL"
"2503"," Thank you. That's all I have.","NULL"
"2504"," OK. Anybody else have anything we need to talk about?","NULL"
"2505"," Apparently not.","NULL"
"2506"," Sounds like it. Thanks everybody. We'll talk to you guys later.","NULL"
"2507"," Bye-bye.","NULL"
"2508"," Bye","NULL"
"2509"," Only a dozen of six words. You're going to ask your ,so that port work with the tile service. Michael, is starting today, what he did. If there is a little background, I can compile.","NULL"
"2510"," We'll try tomorrow .","NULL"
"2511"," Sounds good.","NULL"
"2512"," The best if he says he's going to take care of the branch code. I'll do that tomorrow. I have somewhere to work. That's for the historical based.","NULL"
"2513"," I had to ask her . I think so. ","NULL"
"2514"," It was their baby . I'll look at the basic. Oh, man but he said that he was smart. I only try to look one of the clients, which was already against it. Then, come up some tasks. We're having a little point to give what comes up. At this point, I want to have this.","NULL"
"2515"," Yeah, actually...","NULL"
"2516"," You got to teach...","NULL"
"2517"," I want to try and load one of the clients. I'll do that on mine, and then come up with some task that we haven't at this point accomplished. At this point you know more than I do, so you have to teach me.","NULL"
"2518"," He showed me where to look in a code, where are the configures to toggle, things like that. What to pull over so... I just did it . We could build on that machine if you want to look at the code.","NULL"
"2519"," Let's look at the program first and then the code. Then it'll make more sense to me. I'll see if I can just...","NULL"
"2520"," Also, we had talked briefly about what kind of functionality it would need. Michael said disregard the boundary thing. We will care about how our company,we will care about anything except placing access on the map , so we're running differently.","NULL"
"2521"," Michael said that?","NULL"
"2522"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2523"," And only Michael said that?","NULL"
"2524"," Only Michael, that's true. Only Michael.  I'll go check with...","NULL"
"2525"," Because Karen would validate that from the user's perspective, as she's going to be testing it. She may have different expectations.","NULL"
"2526"," I'll go through and try to install the Tile service client for J.R.M, see if I can get that done. That will help me.","NULL"
"2527"," Hopefully it worked for you, but we had to go through some crazy hoops with the IIS stuff that Michael couldn't initially. It's kind of crazy.","NULL"
"2528"," I want to see what issues we encounter.","NULL"
"2529"," We'll see what issues we encounter.","NULL"
"2530"," How you feel about it so far? Worried?","NULL"
"2531"," I'm not really worried. I get what we're doing. I get what you do, I just don't know where to start. I'm kind of overwhelmed.","NULL"
"2532"," Al right let's see...","NULL"
"2533"," ...if I can read this.","NULL"
"2534"," NYW is dot com? . It says dot com.","NULL"
"2535"," All right,  2-3-0-1-0-6.","NULL"
"2536"," Do you have that port on you?","NULL"
"2537"," Hopefully, this is the...","NULL"
"2538"," I don't know if this is the map point one or the other tile service one. The tile service one would be to publish.","NULL"
"2539"," I'm going to say JR in collect uses both. Configurable or generic uses just that one, so we're going to move that tile service to JR, and collect.","NULL"
"2540"," We're going to move the top service to support this. I don't know which one it is.","NULL"
"2541"," I know how it went.","NULL"
"2542"," Maybe there was not one for this interview.","NULL"
"2543"," This.","NULL"
"2544"," Don't worry, so I think we've","NULL"
"2545"," Yeah, very original. What was the other one? The one that's published out of the ATM. Is that it probably tile service driven, or now that's production. Sorry.","NULL"
"2546"," Why don't you go ahead and jump on my machine for the time being. That way we can at least look at. Even the is not going to work. We can at least look at...","NULL"
"2547"," The client.","NULL"
"2548"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2549"," OK.","NULL"
"2550"," I can take a look at these.","NULL"
"2551"," You're still going to have.","NULL"
"2552"," It's the community, one of the guys. Actually those are my signals test.","NULL"
"2553"," This right here.","NULL"
"2554"," Close. This is my point that if you want to look at this at all.","NULL"
"2555"," Right.","NULL"
"2556"," I'm still very functional now and I know you can't right click it .","NULL"
"2557"," I can use that.","NULL"
"2558"," I put that for about five minutes . Why can't we just copy?","NULL"
"2559"," I don't know. Right. I'll paste for everybody. You can do that and anything interesting, anything good to know? Anything I need to be aware of for the implementation. Right now basically its just map view, zoom in, zoom out, context menu, copy paste and...","NULL"
"2560"," ... route.","NULL"
"2561"," All of this is going to be available in the Telerik map control. Nothing special there. The assets. There is already code to bring in the assets. Nancy said, ""don't touch that"" . That'll work regardless of the back control so that's nothing new maybe.","NULL"
"2562"," We shouldn't run that.","NULL"
"2563"," We can pull up the code, and it'll load. It was loaded by the interface. Then it started to quit. No maps.","NULL"
"2564"," What code has Baski gone through with you?","NULL"
"2565"," We looked at...map control. The demo bug, the map control. CS , CS file. Those two we looked at. That's where he said our focus is going to be. Yet for some reason that graph design scared me death. why we didn't look below it, the demo file. I have no idea. I discovered that five minutes after meeting with John.","NULL"
"2566"," So all we had to do is click.","NULL"
"2567"," Where was that app?","NULL"
"2568"," I can't remember. Under V-model?  Sink? Go down toward the bottom. Once it's main window, the main window video.","NULL"
"2569"," Here is an example for code files, where we're going to be implementing the Telerik control map, I guess.","NULL"
"2570"," Have you been doing some demo tinkering?","NULL"
"2571"," I've been brushing up on it. I'm an office manager like he said. I found some demos on implementing data maps in Telerik. Since I didn't have the branch code, I weren't able to plug it in and see if it worked","NULL"
"2572"," We do have the Mobile Collect project which has lots of demo examples. It's a different platform, but it should be universal. You need more examples than that. That's not really my only experience with demo at this point, is the Mobile Collect.","NULL"
"2573"," In a minute we can put mobile Collect, because really the only piece of that was of interest there to me was the small little convert file that switched it from map service to...","NULL"
"2574"," Can we look at that?","NULL"
"2575"," Yeah. That's what Michael said to focus in on there.","NULL"
"2576"," This is here.","NULL"
"2577"," Keep using it. I'm sorry.","NULL"
"2578"," Where is the when you need it?","NULL"
"2579"," One second I'll tell you. In code control. Yeah great.","NULL"
"2580"," The problem Michael also mentioned was regardless if we flipped all this to say, always use map files, the program still not going to want to implement what is installed. It's not just copy and paste like you originally said, I guess.","NULL"
"2581"," Yeah. So lots of references to remove from that point until they're off-map. I want to bring those in at run time and run it.","NULL"
"2582"," See if I stuff up.","NULL"
"2583"," Is there any good stuff on the Telerik website that you guys have offered?","NULL"
"2584"," Yeah. I'm trying to find what the demo maps.you see what Michael did, since they want the teller all on. I agree, because it's better to have a bunch of good stuff on there.","NULL"
"2585"," OK. You will.","NULL"
"2586"," That was one we just have to play some.","NULL"
"2587"," OK. Well, my initial meaning for that, time on the schedule today, there was no way you can be able to do that. Get Baskio branch for us tomorrow. That's where we'll start playing. We'll have...","NULL"
"2588"," See if you can build this? Since we think it's one of those 10 problems. If we can build it.","NULL"
"2589"," Does JR collect?","NULL"
"2590"," Yes.build some things, but it's going to be a headache anyway.","NULL"
"2591"," I can do that now, because as soon as I step away, I'm going to be unto other things.","NULL"
"2592"," {pause}","NULL"
"2593"," What do you need the map for?","NULL"
"2594"," I don't have that. That'll have to wait. I log into Frontier. I will hold up on that.","NULL"
"2595"," Whenever you get a chance to do that one.","NULL"
"2596"," Yeah. I can do that, going to get things going. You said David installed that, or who installed that for you?","NULL"
"2597"," That is Baski.","NULL"
"2598"," Baski.","NULL"
"2599"," I haven't seen it on my desk though.","NULL"
"2600"," Is that what you used?","NULL"
"2601"," I used it the first time, in 2006 but I don't understand. So it is a sort of a problem","NULL"
"2602"," I'll get the media for you, and do my best to attend to it today. See if I can get it to four hours.","NULL"
"2603"," I assume that's going to be the Telerik stuff.","NULL"
"2604"," OK.","NULL"
"2605"," ...any issues. Last week we went over the status of everything more in depth. What I thought is, maybe try to switch that up, so one week go more into the status and one week go more into the issues. ","NULL"
"2606"," That being said, as far as what we're working on right now, what everybody's working on, is there any issues that you know of that we need to capture? Is everything still on track?","NULL"
"2607"," FastPath. Are you going to have something for them Friday or not?","NULL"
"2608"," I'll have something.","NULL"
"2609","  Did she give you that template data or anything?","NULL"
"2610","  .","NULL"
"2611"," OK, so they haven't done their part yet.","NULL"
"2612"," Yes.","NULL"
"2613"," Anything else? All right.","NULL"
"2614"," For the to-do list, we're going to wait until after your add-ons. Put that on hold. Conduit kick-off meeting, we're still looking for maybe the week after April the first to do that?","NULL"
"2615"," Yeah, probably, because  two weeks ago, but  .","NULL"
"2616"," Did everybody have a chance to look at those dates for the Agile class? I want to make sure everybody's here when we do that.","NULL"
"2617"," 17th, 18th, and 19th?","NULL"
"2618"," The 19th is a staff meeting.","NULL"
"2619"," The 19th is a staff meeting, so 17th or 18th.","NULL"
"2620"," Yeah, I looked. It was OK.","NULL"
"2621"," We need to  some of these things. Baski, did you figure out how to give a response on some things?","NULL"
"2622"," Yeah. I'll just tell them, ""Hey, I've got it,"" and get a resolution for you soon, or try to give them an ETA, if possible. Not always possible. But I've started to do that on anything, not just the important things that come in.","NULL"
"2623"," I'm not going to change it to 45 yet, since we're going to try going over status one week and issues the next. We've got to keep it at 30 for right now, I wouldn't change it. Let's just look, I saw that, Baski, I don't know if you've noticed, we've got some ideas for training and classes...","NULL"
"2624"," ...in here now. We should just figure out when we want to start implementing that.","NULL"
"2625"," This is internal training?","NULL"
"2626"," Yeah. Right now, Baski asked over the last year or so, back when he was doing Friday classes, for ideas. These don't necessarily have to be done by Baski. If somebody else's got something, an interest that they're willing to, has some expertise in these things and want to give a class on it...","NULL"
"2627"," There can be a class probably back again when they did it, and walk us through the whole scanning program.","NULL"
"2628"," He can walk through the whole thing, so that everybody knows what it does. It doesn't have to be me, anybody can learn something new. I think it's beneficial to everybody. It's just a class.","NULL"
"2629"," I'd just say, maybe over the next week or two, take a look at these. Everybody pick their top one or two and then in the next meeting in a couple of weeks we'll...I'll be here next week, but several people will be out next week it turns out.","NULL"
"2630"," Are you canceling next week's meeting?","NULL"
"2631"," I'm not, if you all can still do it.","NULL"
"2632"," You can cancel it.","NULL"
"2633"," Nobody's here.","NULL"
"2634"," Bad attitude.","NULL"
"2635"," I'll be here.","NULL"
"2636"," I'm pretty sure that was domestic violence. ","NULL"
"2637"," You're sitting next to somebody who's marrying a police officer.","NULL"
"2638"," What?","NULL"
"2639"," You're sitting next to somebody who's marrying a police officer who will turn you in. ","NULL"
"2640","  officer.","NULL"
"2641"," Jenny's joining the police force?","NULL"
"2642"," Can we have a  for the attitude?","NULL"
"2643"," Yeah, she just lost it.","NULL"
"2644"," I'll have to  , no worries.","NULL"
"2645"," OK, again, so everybody just take a look over these and any more that you want to add and we'll pick which ones we want to tackle first. I noticed somebody put the, ""Coding best practices,"" for both uniformity and between applications.","NULL"
"2646"," Actually, I'm talking with Michael about some books and things that we could use. We can talk about that later, though. There's some ideas around that, especially for the new people. Some of us older people are set in our ways, so the likelihood of us changing...","NULL"
"2647"," Bad attitude.","NULL"
"2648"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2649"," That's the way our mind works. Not yet. This one in particular we're going to definitely be working through. But as far as the other ones that are in class people can pick the ones they'd like to see first. With that, on to issues. Did everybody see these? A couple of seconds. Any new ones anybody wants to add to the list?","NULL"
"2650"," It's not really a new one. It's just a concern. I think we need to have a look at this. They had a meeting about this MapPoint and I didn't know there was a meeting. Three different people came to me, ""I spent 20 minutes there asking, 'Where do you use MapPoint? What do you do with it?'"" I said, ""What?"" Three different people are asking me. They had actually they are at the meeting and...","NULL"
"2651"," ...from meeting they called me about how it's done. I said, ""The meeting was only 20 minutes. I should have been in the meeting."" ""Why?"" ""I wasted one hour explaining to three different people, all in the same meeting. I was not in the meeting."" This would have saved time, everybody's time. That's number one.","NULL"
"2652"," I can't type anything in here now, so I'm just going to write it down. Somebody's got it locked.","NULL"
"2653"," Context-switching, it's not an easy task. Because I switched context in almost like nine things now, support,  support, technical support, dashboard support, dashboard. Then I'm using FastPath. Then I'm using  Collect. You can think of  .","NULL"
"2654"," That conversion to  .","NULL"
"2655"," What is that?","NULL"
"2656"," That conversion to  .","NULL"
"2657","  sometimes.","NULL"
"2658"," When you bring the new people, I think we need to a process to do all this new stuff. Because we're starting a new project. They need to have, ""Oh, my God. I'm learning something new. I'm doing something."" We cannot just throw in some new person and say, ""Go ahead and make a change."" They feel so uncomfortable, because it's not the right way to start. I think we need to take a right path.","NULL"
"2659"," Take time, make sure they all know about it. Also, Adam is  on this, the whole MapPoint controversy. I don't know if it's, he really worked on the project, like take the Conduit Project, he worked on it. The context switch took just two hours, definitely made sense. Because he knows what is the context. He can switch it, I understand what's going on.","NULL"
"2660"," They want to put him on the new project for two hours, the context switch is different completely. By the time you get your head around, the two hours is over. You've got to start all over again every day.","NULL"
"2661"," I think, if we can improve that somehow the context switch, if we are switching it, only a person who worked on it. If they want to learn a new application, or whatever new technology, give it to them specifically for a week. Don't just throw them back in and out. It's not good for anybody.","NULL"
"2662"," Context switching, we will add that to the list.","NULL"
"2663"," It sounds like he was also saying, making sure that you have the subject matter expert when you have a meeting.","NULL"
"2664"," Yeah. I don't recall that meeting. I didn't know there was a meeting either.","NULL"
"2665"," Same thing. I didn't know that there was a meeting. I had three people I talked to. From the meeting they called me and said, ""What is it? How it works?"" I said...","NULL"
"2666"," I'd say at least, if you're thinking you don't want to bother somebody when you're having a meeting, put them on there as optional. At least then they know that it's going on. If they don't have time, they can know that if they're getting questions from three different people, and those three different people are at the meeting...","NULL"
"2667"," Also it helps estimate, because I cannot expect them, these two hours, Adam to estimate what is the workload, because they're not even told what to do.","NULL"
"2668"," I know.","NULL"
"2669"," That's so unfair to them. Because I cannot expect them to estimate anything until they fully understand the context.","NULL"
"2670"," For that particular project, you guys...","NULL"
"2671"," They asked me from the meeting, ""How long is it going to take you to swap the MapPoint for this?"" I said, ""It's going to take two weeks."" That's my understanding, but it's not going to be for everybody, because I worked on application I know where to change it. If somebody is learning a new technology, the time frame is completely different.","NULL"
"2672"," I want them to feel comfortable to estimate, than me estimating for them. That's so wrong.","NULL"
"2673"," Moral of the story...","NULL"
"2674"," ...include the person that you're getting help from in the meeting. That one was a special case, but we have them more often than not, it seems like. Going to have some in a month.","NULL"
"2675"," What meetings are you referring to?","NULL"
"2676"," Usually, throughout the day we'll have some meeting with you. Then the next day Brandon and I go over...","NULL"
"2677"," It's not you, you are not involved with the meeting. It is a management level the meeting is taking place where they want to change the mapping cards and map. It's outside development level. It's not...","NULL"
"2678"," We'll, make sure we tell...","NULL"
"2679"," ...them, ""When you're sending messages to people, don't have meetings about our stuff without having somebody from our team.""","NULL"
"2680"," Which is historically a thing...","NULL"
"2681"," ...that happens.","NULL"
"2682"," That building example...","NULL"
"2683"," I've got an example, the building example yesterday. Obviously something changed in the Notify. Everybody is talking about it, except the development team  . The reason is, something changed in the Notify.","NULL"
"2684"," We not even know. You're just walking in, and finding out yesterday afternoon. You said, ""What's going on?""  , ""We need some help from somebody."" Get all the people as soon as possible, so we can all work together and then go through like 10 different  , and finally come to you for three minutes work.","NULL"
"2685"," I don't know if that one's as good an example. I think, we had the right people on that.","NULL"
"2686"," But there are several occasions where there are no development people involved in these decisions where dates and stuff come out of. I'm working on that one. Anything else? I've got that captured here. If we don't want to add anything else, then we can pick one of these to discuss. See if we can move along before we get to talk about the projects and what you're doing.","NULL"
"2687","  are level three, right?","NULL"
"2688"," Part of it, yeah.","NULL"
"2689"," It's a part of that process?","NULL"
"2690"," We can talk about that. I will say, I added revenue on here today. That's all the revenue. We're on payroll by payroll right now. We're trying to get revenue, in essence. The reason I put that down for marking is, we need to know it. We need to about that. Any ideas people have for quick revenue.","NULL"
"2691"," Yesterday we talked with  about getting the Conduit load, and starting to charge for that as JRM if that's something he's interested in. I thought maybe we'd get some money for it. But short of it is, don't go planning anything right now. We really do need to try to wrap things up. It's not really the time for the scope creep.","NULL"
"2692"," Do you have a list of some things we can make, we can do to make a difference?","NULL"
"2693"," I don't know. That's why I put it on there for us to discuss. We've got the annual goals and the quarterly goals, but the biggest thing is wrapping up. Wrapping up LCAM, wrapping up the PURA stuff and all of that...","NULL"
"2694"," ...I discussed a bunch of ideas. He didn't find the time to do it. I didn't have time. Finally I said, ""I'm going to put it in."" I tried to open the  , it's like worse than  . I wanted to just put in a simple idea, give it to somebody. I don't want to go through like 20 pages of .","NULL"
"2695"," It's too heavyweight for us.","NULL"
"2696"," It should be simple. I just got finished saying to somebody, ""I want it like that."" I don't want to go asking so many person. I said, ""You know what? Forget it. I'm not going to do it.""","NULL"
"2697"," OK. That's really good feedback. I think these are some similar feedback. If Ryan and Baski are saying that it's too complicated then...","NULL"
"2698"," I mean, we don't even know how to answer half of the questions that are on there, because we're not experts in that field. I don't know. I could probably estimate how much it would cost for us to do some of those things. But I have no idea what kind of impact it potentially could have on our revenue screen. I don't care.","NULL"
"2699"," It seems like the template is made up for somebody else, and we're just trying to absorb into our process. I feel like it's already build and I just  .","NULL"
"2700"," When we see our software is spread across 400 products and we say, ""We like this piece over here, and we like that piece over here,"" it makes sense for us to put all those pieces together. Somebody ought to be able to look at that, and say, ""Yeah, that sounds like a good idea,"" or, ""No. Shut up, and go do it.""","NULL"
"2701"," Yeah. Immediate feedback, that's good.","NULL"
"2702"," Our agenda is just wrap up what we're doing.","NULL"
"2703"," That seems...","NULL"
"2704"," To me, and we talked about this a little bit before. Getting this thing Notify, the HTML5, and getting the JRM functionality in, is imperative. I think we'll be able to sell a lot more and get a lot more recurring revenue if we do that.","NULL"
"2705"," I know we're  with it developing prototypes now, but we just don't have the resources on the backend. That's imperative. Getting all of that wrapped up, the Conduit stuff, doing that as efficiently as possible, so we that can turn our focus on...The next thing in the roadmap is going to be rewriting Collect to be our mobile.","NULL"
"2706"," That will help the company tremendously, because then you don't have to worry about pictures. Pictures is by far the longest thing it takes them to do. If you can take it with the device, and get a good one, you're going to speed up our running rates tremendously.","NULL"
"2707"," That's what's next thing on deck. It's just a matter of trying to wrap things up. Getting better about scope creep, so we can get onto these. Get these things up,  , is the best thing our team can do.","NULL"
"2708"," Another point I want to add is context that I think goes with that. In implementing, I think, we have multiple work simultaneously scheduled, and they're all depending on one person, that one person is going to hold everybody.","NULL"
"2709"," Because Mahesh cannot do anything, if I'm not getting anything. They cannot do anything unless I help them out. They cannot do anything on FastPath. If we can schedule the time overlapping, next to them, then we can dedicate the time instead of one person holding all of it. I think we need it.","NULL"
"2710"," That's for sure. That's exactly what we want to do. We want to have these teams, like we've got laid out, and have them be able to work on things. I think we all know, LCAM really has killed us. It's taken everybody but you, Baski.","NULL"
"2711"," Oh, and me. I'm not doing anything on it.","NULL"
"2712"," Well, I mean, development-wise. Baski has been stuck with the lion's share of everything else. We've been able to not move all these other things forward. That one, we will definitely try to guard against doing something like that. Yeah. We'll add that to the list, context switch. All right. What do you all want to talk about?","NULL"
"2713"," I still think we really need to talk about new hire integration. This is probably a good venue for that, because I know that you're talking...You're doing a lot of work right now with this MapPoint stuff. I wanted to hear what you thought about, given a bunch of stuff on your plate, and how that makes you feel. Do you feel overwhelmed?","NULL"
"2714"," He's great. I love it.","NULL"
"2715"," They said be honest with it. Let's go for the truth.","NULL"
"2716"," Honesty is good. If that's exactly how you feel, then that's a great thing.","NULL"
"2717"," It's cool. The stress of responsibility has never been an issue. I like just jumping in. But without a lot of support and a lot of real clear direction, it has been a little stressful, a little overwhelming.","NULL"
"2718"," I know Adam's got his plate full, Baski's got his plate full, so I feel so bad, ""I think I broke it,"" or I feel like I'm going every which way, if that makes sense, because I work with Michael, too.","NULL"
"2719"," Has anybody sat down and showed you Collect?","NULL"
"2720"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2721"," How it works, at least?","NULL"
"2722"," Yes.","NULL"
"2723"," Someone's done that.","NULL"
"2724"," Yeah.","NULL"
"2725"," My concern is, you're fresh out of college. Not saying that you don't have experience at all, but when you step into a professional position, I can remember doing it and I had a lot of hand-holding involved. I was given responsibility, but they were small chunks.","NULL"
"2726"," Like, ""We need you to do this little story right here. It might not be a very complicated function, but get your head wrapped around this, and do this part."" It almost seems like you've been given this huge problem with no design, with no direction, with none of that at all and expected to automatically become a developer that's been experienced with that. That's the thing that concerns me.","NULL"
"2727"," It is so important, and it has to be done in whatever days it was given.","NULL"
"2728"," That's what I was going to say. There's a deadline on it.","NULL"
"2729"," Yeah, there's a deadline.","NULL"
"2730"," I know that Jasmine, I think you had a similar experience but in a different light. That's the thing that concerns me, is that we're getting new devs in here, which is a great thing, but we're not building them up. I know with Jasmine, at least she was put on JET, which doesn't do anything for the development team at all, and doesn't do anything for her career, either.","NULL"
"2731"," It's a technology that's useful to John and his team, but it's not useful to us as a development team, because it buys us nothing knowing that, for the things that we have to actually do. That's what I'm concerned about.","NULL"
"2732"," We're pulling devs in, and we're just putting them off on the side, saying, ""Hey, we don't really have time for you right now, but we're paying you, so we expect you to do something. Here's a project for you to do. It's due in two weeks. Go get it done.""","NULL"
"2733"," Or, ""Hey, we're doing a total rewrite of our application. We need you to automatically know HTML5 and JavaScript, and CSS, and all that stuff. Go write that stuff.""","NULL"
"2734"," When in actuality, I feel like anyways should be integrated into our process to where, ""Yeah, I'm working on the story. You haven't done this type of work before. I really want you to sit down with me and do it with me, and then you can ask me questions while I'm doing it, and maybe tomorrow you can drive.","NULL"
"2735"," ""Then, you can try it out, and then I can help you with it, and then maybe next week I'll give you just a small thing that you can do by yourself."" Then, so on and so forth. That's a huge concern of mine.","NULL"
"2736"," We've got the concern. Because we haven't really done ideas in here, we want to try to solve the root problem. The first thing we do, the, ""Why? Why? Why?"" is to get to the root problem. I think we have the root problem on here is that we need a new hire integration process.","NULL"
"2737"," All the concerns we know about. We talked about it. We know about it. There are things going on, probably, that everybody isn't aware of, but yeah, we know the issues. The issue we need to solve is we need a new hire integration process.","NULL"
"2738"," The question is, ""What should those steps be?"" We can start brainstorming ideas. I think Brian just threw out a few. Let's start thinking of what those steps need to be, capture those, and then get them documented.","NULL"
"2739"," Before we hire them they know what the total context is about. Before their hiring, ""This is what we're going to be doing."" They are already lined up. I think for a new hire integration process this is perfect. Once you bring them in there  what we can do now.","NULL"
"2740"," That's not really how...It was thought about, how they do it. One thing that we try to do, that I try to do, is give people the opportunity to forge the path that they're on. Some people are more, they want to do UX, or some people want to be full stack. Some people want to be more of the nuts and bolts.","NULL"
"2741"," These guys, when they come out, they don't necessarily know. They might have ideas, so to try to expose them a little bit to multiple things to see where they're going to be best suited. I had an idea of where they would be when they came on, but it's not necessarily the correct path until they get started on it.","NULL"
"2742"," You don't want to box anybody in a corner, either. That doesn't do any good for Jasmine, to say, ""OK, she's the UX person now."" Not that that's a bad thing, but you would probably want to be a little bit more well rounded than that, versus looking at Miranda and going, ""You're more data or business logic  .","NULL"
"2743"," That might be OK. That's good but it's not great. Branching out is a good thing, focusing on everything a little bit of everything is ideal.","NULL"
"2744"," You talked about sitting with somebody and then learning. Are we talking about pair programming, in essence. How's everybody feel about that? Honestly. Everybody needs to be completely honest about that. ","NULL"
"2745"," That'd be good. I don't know if Miranda feels this way, but I feel like we need to know what the long term goal is for us. There are times where everyone's busy, and we don't want to bother everybody, and we need to know what we can be doing.","NULL"
"2746"," Like, we need to know, what can we be working on besides just scanning through code aimlessly trying to figure out what we can do to help. That's the thing. When I was working on JRM with you, I felt at least useful. It was like every little piece, I felt like, ""OK, I did something. That's good.""","NULL"
"2747"," Then, it gets to the point where everyone's busy, and we're just researching, not getting to feel like we're helping at all. That's hard. It's important to feel like you're doing something beneficial for the company.","NULL"
"2748"," Long-term goals.","NULL"
"2749","  .","NULL"
"2750"," Pair program, anybody opposed?","NULL"
"2751"," As long as it's not scheduled over the weekend, I don't care. ","NULL"
"2752"," Thank you, Baski. I'll pair with Baski.","NULL"
"2753"," It's difficult when you're working on several different things and now you spend an hour actually programming this thing, two hours on troubleshooting issues, and spending an hour on an emergency release that you have to get out. With all of that, there's a lot of context switching going on.","NULL"
"2754"," That's the problem.","NULL"
"2755"," Yeah, that is a problem.","NULL"
"2756"," If we get rid of the context switch, that problem goes away.","NULL"
"2757"," Side bar. Part of this, I'm going to talk with Michael about it. As far as the context switching, maybe we can talk about this in the next meeting, and continue onto this. Let's start thinking about this, but we, as a group, need to start doing a much better job at estimating.","NULL"
"2758"," Whether that's adding factors to our estimates based on what we've historically done or making sure that we have the requirements upfront so we know what's going to be done, and controlling scope creep.","NULL"
"2759"," We as a group have caused a lot of our need to do context switching, because we oftentimes aren't done when we say we're going to be done. For whatever reason that is, and then we end up in a bind because we can't wait until we're done with something before we say we can...We have to keep things in the queue, in the schedule. Maybe next time, be thinking about that.","NULL"
"2760"," I personally think, I'm going to say this until I'm blue in the face.","NULL"
"2761"," But, if our iterations were much more structured, our releases I should say were much more structured, say, ""I know exactly. I've got eight iterations in a release. I've got four iterations of testing tacked onto the end of that, and it becomes a repetitive thing that happens exactly the same every single time, the layout becomes a lot easier.""","NULL"
"2762"," Because during the last four iterations of testing, now I'm starting to plan out the next release.","NULL"
"2763"," I don't want to derail us from the new hire thing. But be thinking about that for the next meeting. Hopefully we'll be able to control the context switching a little bit. We'll figure out how the pair programming works. I've got it on the list. What else? Long-term goals?","NULL"
"2764"," How long are we going to wait? For example,  we are working on something, and it's supposed to be done  . How long are we going to wait before, ""You know what? We're going to put this on the back burner."" Who makes that call how long we're going to wait?","NULL"
"2765"," Product owner.","NULL"
"2766"," That's right. Once you have that streamlined, then I give you everything and say, ""  , come back in two weeks  .""","NULL"
"2767"," Project managers, they will help with that. We can get a ScrumMaster.","NULL"
"2768","  , right?","NULL"
"2769"," Yeah. I want to wait until after we have our class. Hopefully, we're going to make big strides in all that. What else? New hire process. What else? Long-term goals. Pair programming, giving small chunks of responsibility at first.","NULL"
"2770"," You said earlier, just have an overview of the applications that we're going to have them doing these small chunks in. A training session, on just the application itself. Not necessarily a whole lot of detail, but just an actual demo of it, maybe.","NULL"
"2771"," Where  ?","NULL"
"2772"," Anyway, that can come from me, as in Susan or me, or something like that, to do the demo of it, and then, to have a session with the developer to talk about some of the coding, like how the code is laid out or where is the code, with practice in checking in, checking out, and all that stuff.","NULL"
"2773"," There may be some little nuances to how the code works. Susan and I can do the actual education  .","NULL"
"2774"," We had these quarterly or annual reviews, employee reviews. One of the good things that they have on those reviews is, ""The personal goals that you would hope to accomplish for yourself over the next year.""","NULL"
"2775"," That would be in line with trying to give direction to new hires about where they need to invest their time, what type of technologies that you should probably be focusing on. That would feed in with our organizational goals as well.","NULL"
"2776"," If you give us the option of focusing from time to time on what we prefer to do, once we have figured that out, can we  ? Because I feel that I know what I like and if it's an option for me to do that, that's when I have a passion to learn. That's what I want to do is just sit with somebody and learn everything about how to do it.","NULL"
"2777"," That is the plan. That was  the plan for...I know you guys came in and we just can't get out from under LCAM, so, I don't have anybody to sit with you.","NULL"
"2778"," That's what we want to try to do.","NULL"
"2779"," I think that it is that you never bother me, always  . If you have a question, come back. Don't ask, don't even email me. Just walk in. I would love to help you, but you've got to make a step. Don't assume and sit there, just come. It's OK.","NULL"
"2780"," That's what I do.","NULL"
"2781"," It's hard to do that when you're new. You always feel like you're bothering them.","NULL"
"2782"," ...you can't feel that way.","NULL"
"2783"," Open invitation, there.","NULL"
"2784"," Everybody has to be willing to help when they're needed. I ask for a lot of help, so if someone comes to me I feel obligated and I want to help that person back.","NULL"
"2785"," I'd say that what we need to do is get organized about it, too. Going back to the context switching, and all of that, which is one of the first things that was, requested, was how to manage those things. Baski's talked to us a little bit about that. Maybe we'll delve more into that. He'll organize about how we group up questions, and things like, and organize sessions of learning, and things like that.","NULL"
"2786"," What else? I know we're a few minutes over. Anybody have anything else they want to put in? We can start with this or we can pick it back up next time and try to add to this list.","NULL"
"2787"," I think if the teams are structured the right way and the iterations are structured the right way, then the mix will be good on each team to where the new hire can pair program with the thing that they're interested in accomplishing.","NULL"
"2788"," I would really, really try to steer clear of wearing one hat, because you'll get painted as the UI guy, or the business layer guy, where in the Agile world we need to strive to be multipurpose. We're better tools that way in the toolbox.","NULL"
"2789"," When Drake is out, and somebody can step in and be Drake, or Baski's out, and somebody can step in and be Baski, or when Corey's out, then somebody can step in and be a Corey. We're sharper that way.","NULL"
"2790","  .","NULL"
"2791"," I said it before, I'm not a data guy, but I play one on TV. I did stay at Holiday Inn Express last night.","NULL"
"2792"," That's part of the idea about putting the new people on the Sustainment Team so that they can get exposed to all of the different apps and cross-train at the same time. I'll add to the list.","NULL"
"2793"," I heard what Jasmine said when I got here. I thought that I had to call people to ask for help, because I kept hearing people call other people, so I wasn't sure if I should go to someone's desk, or call them. Then I was like, ""I don't like phones,"" so I started going and bothering Brian all the time, which he probably hates.","NULL"
"2794"," You bothered me like three times? Bothered me?","NULL"
"2795"," Knowing that you can get up and go somewhere is good to be told to a new hire. Not you guys, because you guys know that. Your first day walking in, I didn't know what to do.","NULL"
"2796"," It's good we are a small outfit and not part of a big enterprise, because you cannot find people in a big enterprise. You cannot go talk to the database guy if I work for a big company. I cannot make a change in the table and when I ask him, he says, ""OK, next Thursday, we'll meet, we'll talk about it."" That's the beauty of a small  company engagement.","NULL"
"2797"," I'll add all these to the list, as soon as whatever jerk has this thing locked...","NULL"
"2798"," ...will unlock it. Miranda, do you have anything else to add while we're...?","NULL"
"2799"," Everyone's covered all the stuff I was thinking. But I do plan on coming up with something else, and just thinking over and seeing if there's something else I can add. But I think Brian, Jasmine, and Karen covered exactly what I was thinking.","NULL"
"2800"," Good. All right, we'll get this codified and make an actual process. All right,  the meeting.","NULL"
"2801"," You just telling Agile jokes now?","NULL"
"2802"," Yeah, I had to get some brownie points back since I was  .","NULL"
"2803"," Actually a lot of people opened up today, that's good.","NULL"
"2804"," Remind me, because that's what Baski said.","NULL"
"2805"," Thanks.","NULL"

"3867","  Oh, OK.","NULL"
"3988"," I can't imagine when. This one is, they're reverse retiring.  . They're writing assets into the 1220 account. That's why it's this many days. Today, if they go...That actually   , can they do this? Search in assets and reverse retirement of 1220.","NULL"
"4084","  Well, let me see if I know what you're talking about. I'm not at all sure. Have I found hardwire? That hardwire? Partially found. That's a hardwire, right?","NULL"
"4313"," He's usually my good one. The one that puts the tasks out there   .","NULL"
"4321","  Yeah, it's all Brian. I sent that email out this morning. I don't know if you looked at it yet. You know that issue where I said it was weird on those ZFR's? There were two audit trail records that flipped it back. It's also doing it when they manually edit stuff on the edit assets screen.","NULL"
"4426","  It wouldn't be treated like take the old one out and replace it with the new one?","NULL"
"4462"," chance to look it. I want to go to Basky, will you note?","NULL"
"4463"," Yes.","NULL"
"4464"," How are they?","NULL"
"4465"," In the middle of the morning. I'm making note of every little, that point area.","NULL"
"4466"," We can look at some of stuff that you come up with. The main thing I want to do is to schedule some time, look at there at least two hours of blocks, sit down and do some of it. I'd never done the fair program.","NULL"
"4467"," I guess it's going to be...","NULL"
"4468"," After you...","NULL"
"4469"," Sorting out?","NULL"
"4470"," Yes. You do an hour. I will do an hour. Then we can see how far we get.","NULL"
"4471"," This is my first point. Big things, so you're going to have to try to bear with me on some things. ","NULL"
"4472"," There's no problem. At this point you've been in the code, you know the basics of it, you know how to structure it, and that's a lot more that I can say. Get it to compile. Just cut that variety.","NULL"
"4473"," ","NULL"
"4474"," Page. I cannot believe I just made a connection between the stuff I did several months ago and then now  . Page. The last name sound familiar, I don't know if it sounds familiar, but I've never met her, I'm kidding.","NULL"
"4475"," ","NULL"
"4477"," We can't screw anything up. Everything is done at the end and so it's not a concern. As long as you don't check anything in until we've vetted everything.","NULL"
"4478"," Is there a way to save it locally, so that I can just...Is that what he did? I'm new to DFS. I'm terrified.","NULL"
"4479"," You work in your local copy. Everything you have is local. Until you decide to check everything in, you could do whatever you like.","NULL"
"4480"," Great. Thank you.","NULL"
"4481"," Any of the things that Basky's talked about so far. He mentioned creating a new view model for the map provider.","NULL"
"4482"," That would have the red map, only it would be in the license key, and all that?","NULL"
"4483"," Mm-hmm.","NULL"
"4484"," Then you would just exclude the other one that has the map point stuff in it? That's what he said.","NULL"
"4485"," We'll have to eventually, after everything's done, they would remove those references. Delete the references in the modules, the map control and EX map point control, and exclude the map control view .xaml from the project control. That's what I was looking at.","NULL"
"4486"," One of the actual things we could talk about is creating a new view. Basky said we needed to create a new...Call it whatever you want to but we'd call it the Telerik control view, or whatever. That's probably fine, more program.","NULL"
"4487"," Right now, we have the map control view. Most likely can take this straight XAML and the class itself.","NULL"
"4488"," On this page, remove the user control stop, and add the reference, or just drop in the Telerik control. We're going to input the same items here.","NULL"
"4489"," I'm all into it.","NULL"
"4490"," It really looks so easy. I guess I just go over my own thing. I need to  . Not the coating itself, but you know.","NULL"
"4491"," I've never made co-changes in the collate projects. I don't worry about anything. Certainly different so it's coming here and  .","NULL"
"4492"," Let me do it this way.","NULL"
"4493"," Is that how they spell tolerate? Is it right?","NULL"
"4494"," I think so.","NULL"
"4495"," Basically going here, we'll replace, I think kind of shortcut method, but we are going to go in here and replace a lot of the records. Mad control, we are going to create the new Telerik control. I'm going to find a new model. Chill a little bit.","NULL"
"4496"," Let's  where we start coding.","NULL"
"4497"," That's fine.","NULL"
"4498"," Go back and mark prints the view model.","NULL"
"4499"," OK. We have new view. A couple of more changes left to be made, but this gets it started.","NULL"
"4500","  space there. Figure out where that's defined at.","NULL"
"4501"," Is that the one that kept crashing? The one we opened once, and it crashed. We couldn't get it open, even if...","NULL"
"4502"," It could be. I don't know.","NULL"
"4503"," I know you talked about  .","NULL"
"4504"," Controls.","NULL"

"4509"," I'm sorry. I'm getting familiar with the code as well.","NULL"
"4510"," That's OK, Adam. The other thing...","NULL"
"4511"," It's the first time I looked at the view model. I don't know much about it myself.","NULL"
"4512"," Maybe not much left else to do other than to take the Telerik control, plug it in, and match up some of the interface methods.","NULL"
"4513"," Some  .","NULL"
"4514"," Well...","NULL"
"4515"," Sounds that way, really. ","NULL"
"4516"," surely not.","NULL"
"4517"," As soon as I got to do it, 5,000 other things emerge. Hopefully not.","NULL"
"4518"," Trace that. Keep creating that, so the typeform has to be XA6. OK, so get field. I'm  , yeah?","NULL"
"4519"," All right, so basically, my understanding is -- limited understanding -- going to take that line out. We'll plug in our Telerik control and that will be the bulk of the work, then trying to figure out mapping the actual functionality, let's wait them out.","NULL"
"4520"," If  well we also got to take it in, this is just a troll. We've created troll and now we've got to go find the user interface aspect of it. With map control view is referenced and what this...","NULL"
"4521"," Do you think you can find an example of where the Telerik control is referenced?","NULL"

"4694"," There's one bug?","NULL"
"4695"," Yeah, there's one bug. The grid stuff is not right, so I don't want to write a bug. It's random, isn't it?","NULL"

"4718"," They may not get that. We just may have to move that to the backlog.  ""Look, this is what you've got. Now what do you not like?"" Because you know they'll come back, and say they don't like something.","NULL"

"4751"," current whatever. The scheme in this introduction.","NULL"
"4752"," My assumption is whoever adds to the database script runs that section that they're adding. They go ahead and do it in dev. That's the assumption I've been going on.","NULL"
"4753"," In dev, that makes sense, but as far as test.","NULL"
"4754"," Right. Whenever we deploy the test then I'll do that.","NULL"
"4755"," As far as I'm concerned you can deploy to test whenever you're ready and we can get back to using...","NULL"
"4756"," Deploy 1.1 test.","NULL"
"4757"," Yeah. For next week...","NULL"
"4758"," when you bring back the database we'll probably take that database and we'll put it on top of my test. That way my test has the latest and we'll quit using the conversion one and we can just go forward from there.","NULL"
"4759"," After he does the merge then I'll deploy the test.","NULL"
"4760"," That's fine, whenever it works for you. If it's one day next week that's fine, because I'll continue to test against conversion until after we get the latest one then we'll drop conversion and go back to using test.","NULL"
"4761"," What I have that we need to talk to them about today. I'm going to ask them what they found out from monitoring the ports because I want to know.  Then the CTDI...","NULL"
"4762"," There's never a dull moment.","NULL"
"4763"," Are you sure you want to know?","NULL"
"4764"," I do, because if we have a problem we need to know, but I don't think we do.","NULL"
"4765"," That's not why you want to know.","NULL"
"4766"," No. It's the second part of that because I don't think we do. I want them to know it's not our problem.","NULL"
"4767"," They don't care.","NULL"
"4768"," I know, I care. Then CTDI and shift two. That's what I have to talk to them about. What do you all have?","NULL"
"4769"," The ""ship to,"" and ""ship,"" that...","NULL"
"4770"," I'm not touching that.","NULL"
"4771"," Code.","NULL"
"4772"," The one they want to load is CLLIs in LCAM?","NULL"
"4773"," Yeah.","NULL"
"4776"," They want to take the location code and...","F"
"4777"," put it in the CLLI field.","NULL"
"4778"," put it in the CLLI field. It's crap.","NULL"
"4779"," I know.","NULL"
"4780"," Use the industry standard.","NULL"
"4781"," I'm talking about the...","NULL"
"4782"," It does work, across applications.","NULL"
"4783"," Fuzzy Logic stuff.","NULL"
"4784"," Yeah, the Fuzzy Logic stuff.","NULL"
"4785"," Can we give that to Kim too?","NULL"
"4786"," He has it.","NULL"
"4787"," He already has the Fuzzy Logic?","NULL"
"4788"," He has it.","NULL"
"4789"," It's in the conversion package.","NULL"
"4790"," The conversion package. They don't understand it, but that's where it is.","NULL"
"4791","  It's somewhere in this  box.","NULL"
"4792","  my hands.","NULL"
"4793"," It's in Arabic too, by the way.","NULL"
"4794"," Upside down and backwards.","NULL"
"4795"," All right it's time to call them.","NULL"
"4796"," Please enter the conference key.","NULL"
"4797"," He doesn't feel good today, so he took the day off and he was already taking tomorrow off.","NULL"
"4798","  tomorrow.","NULL"
"4799"," Hi, who's on the call?","NULL"
"4800"," Jim  .","NULL"
"4801"," Violet.","NULL"
"4802"," Good morning. It's Kim.","NULL"
"4803"," Jim, Violet, and Kim. Anybody else?","NULL"
"4804"," DJ's here.","NULL"
"4807"," I also just got an email this morning that there's another server that has a similar issue, so I'm going to take a look at that and compare and contrast what's happening on our production servers with that server, so...","NULL"
"4808"," Kim when you say...","NULL"
"4809"," it's nice to know we've temporarily fixed what was wrong with our production servers by rebooting them, I don't think that's a long-term solution.","NULL"
"4810"," Kim when you say they're using ports which port is it? Is it connections for the database server, or are they connections for the client Web browser?","NULL"
"4811"," I'm looking at the Web servers and using a tool called TCPView that I downloaded from the Microsoft site, and so it's looking at basically TCP ports.","NULL"
"4812"," Which TCP port, for which service?","NULL"
"4813"," Let's see, does it say?","NULL"
"4814"," If it's HTTP ports, or HTTP traffic, I mean that would help narrow down what the potential problem could be. If it's the ports used by SQL server that could also, that points in one direction or the other, right?","NULL"
"4815"," Right, this particular utility, it tells me what the addresses are that are being attached, so based on that we could probably tell what the local ports are and the remote ports.","NULL"
"4816"," Off the top of my head, if you could narrow it down. Is it network traffic related to the Web servers going to the client, or traffic going back to the database?","NULL"
"4817"," I'm not even sure that this is what caused the issue. But I was tracking some of the errors out of the event log and one of the suggestions pointed me to this utility as a way to monitor. I'm trying to remember.","NULL"
"4818"," I think it actually said that if it ran out of ports it would match up with some of the things that we've been seeing where it appeared to be a network issue, but maybe it's actually not the network maybe it's the interface on the servers running out of resources, making it appear that the issue was a network issue. But as I gather more information I'll let you know.","NULL"
"4819"," OK.","NULL"
"4820"," OK.","NULL"
"4821"," Ask him what's on the other server that you're talking about?","NULL"
"4822"," Pardon?","NULL"
"4823"," What's on the other server that's having similar issues that you were talking about?","NULL"
"4824"," Actually it was one of the disaster recovery servers.","NULL"
"4825"," Right, and so that's what, again, doesn't make any sense and you might want to look at your remedy tickets because it seems like the virtual server for LCAM in Fort Wayne, you just got a remedy ticket on it?","NULL"
"4826"," Yes, that's what I'm looking at.","NULL"
"4827"," Yeah, again, did Roger ever come back to say there was anything else, any other server in that data center that was having issues?","NULL"
"4828"," I chatted with him this morning, I IMd with him this morning and he said that there's nothing else that he's aware of, that he's heard of, or seen that would be similar to what we're experiencing.","NULL"
"4829"," At some point you can certainly get Matt involved, since they're his virtual servers, and ask him to put some resources towards it.","NULL"
"4830"," He contributed a little yesterday. He responded to my email so I plan to pursue this with him too, thanks.","NULL"
"4831"," OK, thank you.","NULL"
"4832"," The other thing that I had on my list was the CTDI interface and the ship to email that came out this morning. I don't know what our options are at this point and we don't have time to make code changes, so I don't think putting the ship to codes in as CLLIs is a viable solution.","A"
"4832"," The other thing that I had on my list was the CTDI interface and the ship to email that came out this morning. I don't know what our options are at this point and we don't have time to make code changes, so I don't think putting the ship to codes in as CLLIs is a viable solution.","F"
"4836"," Yeah, a week-and-a -half, two weeks.","NULL"
"4837"," That they didn't have CLLIs because initially they were thinking that the ship to codes, or the to location codes were CLLIs. But, no we haven't tried to do the Fuzzy Logic Lookup.","NULL"
"4838"," Does Mike  , does he have the complete set of data elements or the Afinium ship to locations that he called a CLLI but it wasn't a CLLI? Does he have that?","NULL"
"4839"," From what I've seen, I've only seen the location code and address. I don't remember anything else from that spreadsheet.","NULL"
"4840"," What do you mean by ""address""?","NULL"
"4841"," Cities, states, zip.","NULL"
"4842"," It did have the street?","NULL"
"4843"," I'm pretty sure, but I'll have to look at that spreadsheet again to...","NULL"
"4844"," I think it did from what I remember from what you sent me, it had a street.","NULL"
"4845"," Yes, pretty sure it had the street on there, too.","NULL"
"4846"," I think it had a location name there, too, or something like that.","NULL"
"4847"," Did it?","NULL"
"4849"," That was from CTDI what they got from Afinium? We're talking the same thing, right?","NULL"
"4850"," It was probably on the spreadsheet that Mike sent, I think. Let's see.","NULL"
"4851"," If you're leaving it on me I don't have any options right now. Somebody else can assist. I don't know.","NULL"
"4852"," Yes, I don't know what our options are right now, Jim. Let's see. I'm looking at the spreadsheet. We do have the street address, city, and ship to source code. Wait a minute. Some of these look like CLLIs.","NULL"
"4853"," Yes, some of their location codes they have made look similar to CLLIs. Some of them have underscores in them. Some of them have...","NULL"
"4854"," Like the one example I sent, Marion, Maine, I just picked it because that's where I live, but coincidentally the street address was the same. I know we have all sorts of versions out there so that wasn't meant to act like, ""Oh, this is easy to do.""","NULL"
"4855"," But Kevin and I went down different paths with some Afinium people but we kept going down these paths, and it's like, there was no table that gave those Afinium ship to type locations tied to anything we could map actually there.","NULL"
"4856"," Even if we put those in...","NULL"
"4857"," I was like you. I was waiting for procurement to come through. I kept thinking, ""Well, he must have something."" Then Tom's last email was like, ""Oh...""","NULL"
"4858"," Even if those do look like CLLIs they still don't have...They don't have the company, like the Afinium company and the OACs.","NULL"
"4859"," We're left with the same situation.","NULL"
"4860"," That's what I mean, that's where we're left.","NULL"
"4861"," It still doesn't help us because it's still going to...","NULL"
"4862"," Right. Exactly, because...","NULL"
"4863"," Yes, they weren't CLLI codes. They had sometimes a full name, sometimes part name, sometimes...Like, Marion had, ""Marion 222,"" on it, because that's the street address, but then those is what we were trying to tie to at least some kind of Afinium company, and that's where we came to dead ends. They don't do that in their world.","NULL"
"4864"," What about a combination of city, state and zip? Would that get us pretty close to an Afinium company?","NULL"
"4865"," I think it would. I'd leave the street address off if you still don't get multiple hits.","NULL"
"4866"," There's two options, maybe three. Somebody goes in and hand-jams brand-new CLLIs for all of these location codes that they've got, and then somebody at CTDI would have to tie those location codes back to the CLLI code change on their part.","NULL"
"4867"," Number two is use some sort of Fuzzy Logic magic to group up data in that spreadsheet to data in LCAM to get a CLLI so that they can map a location code to the CLLI code change on CTDI's part. Or number three, we force all of the location codes into the CLLI field, which probably won't work, because I thought I saw some that were larger than 13 characters, and they don't follow a normal path.","NULL"
"4868"," We may be able to just take the first 11 or 13 of it and have the rest of it in something else, and they would send over the raw location code coaching on our part. There's only three options.","NULL"
"4869"," I do believe...","NULL"
"4870"," Mike was willing, if we could...","NULL"
"4871"," was hoping it just had a one-to-on match to it up-front, before I send it to you.","NULL"
"4872"," What was that, Jim?","NULL"
"4873"," I think Mike  , if we did have the mapping one-to-one for the Afinium location to ship via CLLIs for LCAM I think he was willing to do that on his end up-front.","NULL"
"4874"," If we send a one-time cross...?","NULL"
"4875"," Yeah.","NULL"
"4876"," Could we get the low-hanging fruit right now? There's always going to be...","NULL"
"4877"," What's that?","NULL"
"4878"," Can we get the low-hanging fruit right now? There's obviously going to be some of that stuff matches perfectly, right? Everything matches on address perfectly.","NULL"
"4879"," I don't know how many that would end up being, but that seems like it would be a pretty simple query to perform is just take what we have on that spreadsheet, take what we have in LCAM, do a join based on the address fields.","NULL"
"4880"," There might be 10,000 location codes in there. You might end up with a thousand matches, but at least that's a thousand that you would have that we don't have to look at again. That would be low-hanging fruit to me.","NULL"
"4881"," That could be done by someone else other than you.","NULL"
"4882"," Yes. I'm strapped...","NULL"
"4883"," I know.","NULL"
"4884"," right now. I'm trying to do the Verizon thing.","NULL"
"4885"," Jim, is the list that Mike sent out, is that an exhaustive list? Because he only sent out of 300 and something ship to codes or location codes.","NULL"
"4886"," Let's see. That's the other problem. I'm getting a lot of different lists, working on different projects. What list was that?","NULL"
"4887"," That was an email from...Actually that was from you.","NULL"
"4888"," Initially Mike sent it out. It was called, ""Missing,"" underscore, ""CLLI,"" underscore, ""Code.""","NULL"
"4889"," I took care of that. That was unrelated. That's another project. Sorry. They sent another one out for me to find the OAC. I was wondering if it was this project, but he clarified it wasn't.","NULL"
"4890"," Oh.","NULL"
"4891"," That's why I was asking earlier, ""Have we really ever gotten a complete list so we know what we're dealing with?""","NULL"
"4892"," Do we actually need the list of ship tos and addresses from Afinium?","NULL"
"4893"," He might have the same copy. I'd rather get it from him if that's where we're...","NULL"
"4894"," That makes sense, because it's his data.","NULL"
"4895"," That's fine.","NULL"
"4896"," He gets it from Afinium. He's already been set up with Afinium for a while.","NULL"
"4897"," We need to get that list, and then if we can do like Brian said, just be able to get an exact match on the address information, then we can find the CLLI based on that. I don't know how many would be an exact match versus ones that are close.","NULL"
"4898"," Yes, if you had his list, say the primary fields are the Afinium locations, of whatever they call it, ship to, and then the address, city, state, zip code, and I liked Brian's first suggestion if you just go by the city, state, zip code and then maybe list them all side by side, and then the ones that match versus the ones that didn't, we could possibly get somebody to help manually do some of those to at least get started.","NULL"
"4899"," Or if your first pass is with the city or the address, then the second pass leave that out and see if it's close. Does Afinium or LCAM, what's your quantity of ship via CLLIs?","NULL"
"4900"," I don't know how many we have.","NULL"
"4901"," That's a good question.","NULL"
"4902"," I was just looking at that.","NULL"
"4903"," Let me get with Mike. I'll have him send what he has. If he doesn't then I'll have to get with Afinium's whole team to see if we can get what they have.","NULL"
"4904"," If you can get that to us as soon as you can then we'll go from there.","NULL"
"4905"," All right.","NULL"
"4906"," OK. I guess if we're through talking about that the third thing on my list was...I don't know. I heard somebody else join. Was that Ron, by any chance? OK, I guess not. The Shields interface stuff I know Brenda sent another email this morning, and we've looked briefly at that.","NULL"
"4907"," All those shipments for new equipment yesterday that came from Shields were sent as good equipment. This morning they started sending new equipment as ""adds,"" like they should be. The stuff that Brenda sent the emails about this morning that we'll have to clean up to get them to go into LCAM.","NULL"
"4908"," Who does the clean up?","NULL"
"4909"," We do.","NULL"
"4910"," OK. I couldn't remember.","NULL"
"4911"," It'll be me, or Adam, or Grady. One of us will be working on that.","NULL"
"4912"," He didn't set it up yet?","NULL"
"4913"," Well, apparently he did it maybe instead of...I thought it was supposed to be the night before last at midnight, but apparently that didn't happen, and maybe it happened last night at midnight, because we did see some that came in early this morning that were adds and that's as far as we got to look.","NULL"
"4914"," Yes, the first ones came in about 4:28 this morning Central. I don't know which time zone that is, but 4:28 this morning was when the first new equipment message was received.","NULL"
"4915"," All right. OK.","NULL"
"4916"," Yes, so we'll work on cleaning up those previous ones that they sent that were sent with incorrect information, and anything from today forward we can hope that it's working correctly.  Like I said, we haven't had a chance to follow it all the way through and make sure, but it did create assets.","NULL"
"4917"," The assets are getting written on, the ones I've checked. Even the one we looked at this morning, it did get written on.","NULL"
"4918"," OK. I must have been putting in the pin wrong.","NULL"

"4920","  , but so far, things are getting written on as expected.","NULL"
"4921"," I guess that was the last really untested part of the interface that we had. Right now we can cross our fingers and say that we're good with that interface.  We think we're good with that interface, anyway. That was all I had on my list. Did you all have anything that we needed to talk about this morning?","NULL"
"4923"," A couple of days?","NULL"
"4924"," we're not going to have the data until after the 2nd.","NULL"
"4925"," Oh my God. ","NULL"
"4926"," We would be starting either very late on the 2nd or early on the 3rd of April.","NULL"
"4927"," What I had on April 1st was that you would cut off access to LCAM so that we could do a backup of your production database, and then LCAM would remain down until all the conversion was done. Is that not the plan?","NULL"
"4928"," We're actually not going to get the data until maybe early on the 3rd. There's really no reason to take down the database on the 1st...","NULL"
"4929"," Let's back up a little bit, because...","NULL"
"4930"," on the application.","NULL"
"4931"," It's 12 hours' worth of work.","NULL"
"4933"," No. We don't care.","NULL"
"4934"," I don't have an issue with that.","NULL"
"4935"," It's just going to take us that many hours to do the work. You tell us...","NULL"
"4936"," you and Larry and Kim think about that.","NULL"
"4937"," What she's saying will help us out, so...","NULL"
"4938"," Yeah.","NULL"
"4939"," It will help us out.","NULL"
"4940"," Jim you have to drop  , so do you want to weigh in on that?","NULL"
"4941"," That's why I put it that way.","NULL"
"4942","  . Kim, what do you think the issues are, taking it down? We asked for techs to be available on Saturdays, and they say they do not schedule work on Saturdays. Unless Jim or Larry or our team's going to be in there on Saturday, I don't see...","NULL"
"4943"," When we did a look at the data that was falling into  , I haven't looked at the data falling into LCAM, but nearly every Saturday and Sunday, weekend days, and even sometimes holidays, we saw transactions falling into  from people doing scanning.","NULL"
"4944"," No, they weren't, because we will turn them off.","NULL"
"4945"," It was very much reduced from the weekdays, but there were still some transactions.","NULL"
"4946"," I think to DJ's point, by stopping on Friday afternoon, it allows us to get about half of the work that we have to do done Friday evening instead of eight hours or nine hours of work, total, that we have to do...If we don't bring it down on Friday night, and we can't bring it down until Saturday, you're not going to be back up Monday morning, because it takes us longer. The hours are on there.","NULL"
"4947"," ISO43, like at 4:00 PM Pacific...Anyway, it doesn't matter. I don't think it's any big deal. I'll check with Jim, because he has a drop. At this point, Susan, just plan on having it by 5:00 PM Pacific on the 1st.","NULL"
"4948"," OK. Kim, will you be able to do the, I think it was step seven?","NULL"
"4949"," He probably doesn't know...","NULL"
"4950"," Which is the scripts.","NULL"
"4951"," Sure, I can run the scripts. Are they scripts that I need to create, or scripts that you're creating and you just need me to launch?","NULL"
"4953"," If it's possible, if I can give you those scripts, that would be a great help to me, a great benefit to me, to get you to run those on your network, without actually having to have a VPN established. Or, if you could point me to a...","NULL"
"4954"," Yes, that's something I can do.","NULL"
"4955"," database server that I can remote into and execute the scripts, I could do that as well. The main thing I'm trying to get around is having a VPN drop and the extract stop.","NULL"
"4956"," Yes, I can do that.","NULL"
"4957"," Thank you very much.","NULL"
"4958"," Thanks. For now, we'll just assume that schedule is good enough. If something comes up and changes that, then you all just let us know, and we'll go from there. Anything else we need to talk about? I know it's been a long call, but we have a lot going on. ","NULL"
"4959"," Yeah, Susan, no rush on the email I sent yesterday for the change request. I know they want to take their time and do it right and give as correct an estimate as possible. We did our best-guess scenario, and that's all we could do. I wanted to let you know not to have to push that through faster than they wanted to do it.","NULL"
"4961"," I know, and I did not expect the window to close that quickly. I should be getting used to it, I should be used to it, but I keep thinking something's going to change. But don't worry about it.","NULL"

"7039","  Oh, OK.","NULL"
"7160"," I can't imagine when. This one is, they're reverse retiring.  . They're writing assets into the 1220 account. That's why it's this many days. Today, if they go...That actually   , can they do this? Search in assets and reverse retirement of 1220.","NULL"
"7256","  Well, let me see if I know what you're talking about. I'm not at all sure. Have I found hardwire? That hardwire? Partially found. That's a hardwire, right?","NULL"
"7485"," He's usually my good one. The one that puts the tasks out there   .","NULL"
"7493","  Yeah, it's all Brian. I sent that email out this morning. I don't know if you looked at it yet. You know that issue where I said it was weird on those ZFR's?
