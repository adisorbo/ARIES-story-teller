"1"," Where's Susan?","NULL"
"2"," I'm here. I am desperately trying to get the board to show up.","NULL"
"3"," She's too busy to push the button to answer the phone. Patrick had to do it. He was closest to the phone.","NULL"
"4"," I'm sorry. Deal with it. I haven't even written down what day of the week it is yet.","NULL"
"5"," It's Friday.","NULL"
"6"," It's Friday.","NULL"
"7"," I have to write this crap down because I have to have all my notes. Grady is done with all of his stuff.","NULL"
"8"," I've got a first  . Tested it the best I can.","NULL"
"9"," Have you deployed it?","NULL"
"10"," No, that's what 1.1 is doing.","NULL"
"11"," He's got to test it!","NULL"
"12"," OK, well I haven't deployed 1.1 yet.","NULL"
"13"," You did. Last week. We tested some of it.","NULL"
"14"," Yeah but this is not that 1.1. I'll do 1.1 in a bit. A 1.1 build later today. I'll deploy it for you.","NULL"
"15"," What else will we  ?","NULL"
"16"," Do we need to...?","NULL"
"17"," Nothing from me.","NULL"
"18"," Nothing from me. ","NULL"
"19","  merge back.","NULL"
"20"," Should already be indexed. I'll build that from  second merge is done.","NULL"
"21"," So you don't have any updates on these because you spent the whole day doing other practice for the area. Are going to get finished before next Friday?","NULL"
"22"," Dang right I will.","NULL"
"23","  Is it going to be right?","NULL"
"24"," Of course.","NULL"
"25"," It'll compile well. That's really all we need. It compiles. Adam. So you know how this one's...So you need to...","NULL"
"26"," Yeah.","NULL"
"27"," You'll add a task on that one. Who thinks he can get this done? For one thing, because, like I told him, I don't care if the tester gets updated because it needs to be tested with CTDI next week anyway.","NULL"
"28"," So if you can just get it done and then test with them and fix anything, then update the tester after the fact so that somebody can actually test against it, we could get away with that this time if we can get it in.","NULL"
"29"," I mean, I would rather it be in 1.1 just so we'll be done done with everything related to that interface and not have it hanging over us.","NULL"
"30"," Yeah, that'll knock some time off. Not having to update the tester.","NULL"
"31"," Yeah, as long as the tester gets updated like the week after or two weeks after so that it's available for when we need to do tests on the interface, because he's also off that week that you're off. That's why I'm like, stuff's got to be done. It's got to be right because you all are off, which is allowed. Just got to be done.","NULL"
"32"," With your permission, right?","NULL"
"33"," As long as your stuff is done and it's right.","NULL"
"34"," Of course.","NULL"
"35"," Mamma has spoken.","NULL"
"36"," Yeah. Well, that's life.","NULL"
"37"," I could finish that story up if I could just...","NULL"
"38"," If you could ever get two hours.","NULL"
"39"," If I could get an hour and a half, two hours together. I could finish that one. I'll finish today.","NULL"
"40"," OK. That'll be good. If he's going to finish this one today, it would actually be good to wait until Monday to get our next release because then we'll have the reports that we can test and this serialized change on the UI.","NULL"
"41"," Now you've put the pressure on me. Now I can't do it.","NULL"
"42"," build until next week.","NULL"
"43"," I'm just kidding. It's OK.","NULL"
"44"," We're going to be building 1.1 next week because we're going to have to because it has to be done next week so some of this stuff has to be being tested. If he can get this finished today and you all get everything merged back then you can make the build today but I would say let's wait on this because otherwise, the only thing we have is that report to test.","NULL"
"45"," The other report was available the last time you built for me. I just haven't tested it yet.","NULL"
"46","  .","NULL"
"47"," That's all you've got. Yeah. Grady and Drake and Patrick.","NULL"
"48"," Still chipping away at it. Get the details on a separate page. On a search page, you jump already to the second page, about to add all the old value, new value stuff. Chipping away at it. Didn't get all that done yesterday. Other questions and stuff.","NULL"
"49"," When do you realistically think it might be something that you can release to us for testing? Like, next Wednesday ish or going to be later? If it's later, then it's later.","NULL"
"50"," Yeah, hopefully.","NULL"
"51"," Hopefully by Wednesday. I mean, it shouldn't take us that long to test. I put something like four hours down, because we've got to  the data and then we've to go in and play around with all the...","NULL"
"52"," I can knock out a good chunk of it today. There will be a good first look there. I'd hope you'd have something functional Wednesday, even if it's still rough.","NULL"
"53"," That sounds good. You all want to look at mine just so you all can laugh how I haven't done anything?","NULL"
"54"," There it is. All of this has my name on it. Let's see what Kevin  . Yeah, he's supposed to test that and...","NULL"
"55"," The only thing I got is the CTDI stuff.","NULL"
"56"," Yeah, which you can't do anything on right now.","NULL"
"57"," Which I can't do, yeah. And remove the header. That's the new...has nothing needed, right?","NULL"
"58"," Yeah, it's not ready yet either. That's the one Adam said if he could get two hours, he could get it done today.","NULL"
"59"," I've got the other two done.","NULL"
"60"," Do we have anything that we need to talk to them about today? No? That's good. Today is what? 3/18. Friday.","NULL"
"61"," What's the deal on the projects for the shipments coming in?  shipments.","NULL"
"62"," It was because the projects table had duplicates. It had multiple blanket projects in it. It was a conversion issue.","NULL"
"63"," So it's just getting the top one out of multiple matching...","NULL"
"64"," Yeah.","NULL"
"65"," I saw the email.","NULL"
"66"," It should not be a problem and all of them are prior to 3.16 that have that and we fixed it one day this week. I'm assuming late on the 15th or on the 16th because they've gone places. I'm going to hang up and call into the call now, Kevin.","NULL"
"67"," See you guys.","NULL"
"68"," All right. Bye.","NULL"
"69"," Please enter the conference pin number.","NULL"
"70"," Is Grady going to do that?","NULL"
"71"," Yeah.","NULL"
"72"," Hey, it's Cathy Jenkins.","NULL"
"73"," Hey Cathy. Is anybody else on the call? Hi, who joined?","NULL"
"74"," Hello, it's Kim.","NULL"
"75"," Hey Kim. Hi, who joined? Hey Jim. Hi, who joined?","NULL"
"76"," Kevin.","NULL"
"77"," Hi DJ. Hey Kevin. I have Cathy Jenkins, Kim, Jim, DJ, Kevin. We don't have anything for you guys this morning. Do you all have anything for us?","NULL"
"78"," I do not.","NULL"
"79"," I do not.","NULL"
"80"," I do not.","NULL"
"81"," This is Kim. I do.","NULL"
"82"," OK.","NULL"
"84"," Just send it to us.","NULL"
"85"," Yeah.","NULL"
"86"," For instance, yesterday, we found that on some assets, there's no status. The status field is blank.","NULL"
"87"," That's not good.","NULL"
"88"," I think there were not just one or two. There were 70 some. Anyway. Do you just want us to put that together and email? Our concern is, we don't want to start putting stuff in there and get it confused with maybe an issue that already exists. You understand what I mean?","NULL"
"90"," That's kind of what we've used. We started using it because, for the Verizon assets, they wanted to keep up with the sequence number but then Brian was also using it to keep up with other data that he entered.","NULL"
"91"," If you look at the legacy ID field, he's had a pattern that he's used. He's actually out of the office today otherwise he could elaborate on that. It doesn't matter to us. We don't use that legacy ID field for anything.","NULL"
"92"," It will have the sequence number in it for the Verizon data so that it can be tied back to the Infinium or whatever that sequence number was related to. As far as the code, the code doesn't look at that legacy ID for anything.","NULL"
"95"," That's what we thought when we saw it. We don't know all the ins and outs of BellCam. Thank you.","NULL"
"96"," Was that it?","NULL"
"97"," That's it for me.","NULL"
"98"," Thanks everybody. We'll talk to you guys later.","NULL"
"99"," Thank you.","NULL"
"100"," Bye bye.","NULL"
"101"," That was good. Except for that.","NULL"
"102"," It was good. We have a  meeting. Just want to have it now.","NULL"
"103"," How can we have everything in LCAM  makes it not  figure it out?","NULL"
"104"," Please enter your conference...","NULL"
"105"," Are you calling anyone?","NULL"
"106"," Suze. She's probably in.","NULL"
"107"," Hi. Who do we have on the call?","NULL"
"108"," Jim's on.","NULL"
"109"," Hey, Jim.","NULL"
"110"," Alden's here.","NULL"
"111"," Alden North, I guess.","NULL"
"112"," Ken?","NULL"
"113"," Hey.","NULL"
"114"," What's up, ""Batman?""","NULL"
"115"," Not much. How are you?","NULL"
"116"," Hi, who just joined?","NULL"
"117"," It's Kevin.","NULL"
"118"," Hey, Kevin.","NULL"
"119"," That's  this scanner.","NULL"
"120"," Crickets, man, crickets.","NULL"
"121"," Then, but tomorrow  .","NULL"
"122"," Get the whole team, except for Susan!","NULL"
"123"," Is it functional yet?","NULL"
"124"," Yeah.  on a call.","NULL"
"125"," That was quick. Usually people take longer to dial in.","NULL"
"126"," We just had to ask her. She was calling in to  .","NULL"
"127"," Oh, we both dialed in fairly early.","NULL"
"128"," I don't even know if anybody else is going to join.","NULL"
"129","  .","NULL"
"130"," It is. Just looking at it's like...","NULL"
"131"," Larry, are you on?","NULL"
"132"," Larry  .","NULL"
"133"," How do we put the phone in  recall?","NULL"
"134"," I don't want that.","NULL"
"135"," Called up. They could hear me. I couldn't hear anybody. So, they might be talking to us.","NULL"
"136"," Hi, who joined?","NULL"
"137"," Hi, it's DJ.","NULL"
"138"," Hey, it's Larry. Larry.","NULL"
"139"," Hey DJ, hey Larry.","NULL"
"140"," What's with Larry Larry?","NULL"
"141"," I'm actually not at the office right now. Guys, do we have anything that we need to update them on?","NULL"
"142"," I guess they can get a quick update on email that they just sent regarding the received equipment from  . I've updated the ones that still have WMS as the bin. Those either came in while I was  on the 17th, or immediately after, so I've corrected those last few.","NULL"
"143"," Everything that's come in since has come in with the correct bin, so that issue has been addressed.","NULL"
"144"," There's two other items on there that I'm still looking into, and we'll get back to you guys as soon as we can. Regarding the  that seems to be occurring, and the part number. The batches and the part number.","NULL"
"145"," Hey, Jim, were you able to get any response from Ron at  ?","NULL"
"146"," Actually, I dropped the ball there. I was on another project, so I didn't get him. It's on my to-do list. I've worked with Brenda, just didn't give her  because she sent me something else, an email. She pulled a report from another screen, gave the details on  .","NULL"
"147"," Yeah, we just don't know if they're even trying to send anything for new equipment across the interface.","NULL"
"148"," Right. Get that solved. It was on the...I think he knew he was supposed to, right?","NULL"
"149"," I think he knew he's supposed to.  Yeah.","NULL"
"150"," Yeah. He is aware, and I've been checking with him since Wednesday. I just haven't got a response back from him, especially on the new equipment. So, I'm just hoping to get some kind of feedback from him.","NULL"
"151"," I'll be calling him.","NULL"
"152"," So, that's the only update we have for you guys. Do you all have anything you want to talk about?","NULL"
"153"," You mean...","NULL"
"154"," Yeah.","NULL"
"155"," No, I don't think so.","NULL"
"156","  .","NULL"
"157"," He's trying to slack off, guys.","NULL"
"158"," Can you think of anything else?","NULL"
"159"," I'm sorry, go ahead.","NULL"
"160"," No, I was going to ask you first. Larry and I had a few things, but I felt like you were...","NULL"
"161"," SQL could be  . Commands can go back and forth a lot.","NULL"
"162"," Larry and I tried to  up to your  . There have been critical ones in your world, so we  yesterday. Look at our active logs.","NULL"
"163"," ...specific on the ones that are critical. We ought to start with those. Larry and I can start, and you can time  .","NULL"
"164"," Yeah, that's fine.","NULL"
"165"," Like  , I don't have email in front of me, but basically you've got a high level...Susan's team, I guess when they go in there to do the approval. Pretty much the status is already set, so they're restricted, and can't redo something.","F"
"165"," Like  , I don't have email in front of me, but basically you've got a high level...Susan's team, I guess when they go in there to do the approval. Pretty much the status is already set, so they're restricted, and can't redo something.","A"
"166"," An example would be of, it's like a forward stocking, LCAM says it's out there, but then when we talk tech with  , the packet is not there, or some some situation that can't use that. They can't go back and change it to pick it up in stock.","A"
"167"," Interesting.","NULL"
"170","  .","NULL"
"171"," They can do that. I responded to Jimmy's email, I think just a few minutes ago. The problem there is that she's looking at  to see what's available. The specific item that she gave an example on is not available in LCAM because it's already sourced for other shipments.","NULL"
"172"," I think she's doing the right process, but she's not looking in LCAM to see why it's telling her that, that equipment isn't available when she looks on the shelf. At least I think that's what that screenshot was of.","NULL"
"173"," I sent some screenshots and explained what I did. That might help.","NULL"
"174"," Go ahead.","NULL"
"175"," Did you put everyone through  ?","NULL"
"176"," I just sent it a few minutes ago. Let me see. I see...","NULL"
"177"," Actually, this is the one. This one I sent this morning.","NULL"
"178"," Mostly that was to Jimmy. I don't know if I  other one  . This one was from Linda. They were kind of describing the same thing. It has IM group on there. I don't know if you're part of that or not, Larry.","NULL"
"179"," Don't worry. I'll forward it to Larry. I've got it.  , Thank you.  related  .","NULL"
"180"," The other one is, it's related to the same situation, and maybe not. Let's say that  our  members ordered more  , and three of them are in stock, and one is not in stock.","NULL"
"181"," Normally, what we've done in the past is, we would be able to split that order so you would be able to push through and process  available. Create  a different order for the one that was not in stock. You would put in for that order's status.","F"
"182"," Whether they can or they can't do that, or if it's not possible, they have to be able to figure out how to do that.  is something that can be addressed, or...?","NULL"
"184"," You click that, and you can say split it off, and you can...","NULL"
"185"," Quantity...","NULL"
"186"," ...orders are right...","NULL"
"187"," ...with that one. Two, or one, or I don't really know...","NULL"
"188"," ...line item. For that  . And then you treat it however you want to, whether you want to source it from your location, or...","NULL"
"190"," That one, I would...","NULL"
"191","  let them understand it and do the work...","NULL"
"192"," Wait a minute. They can split the order, but their question is the approval process. They said that we can't approve them separately.","NULL"
"194"," I understand what you're saying. So if you had, again, four items, you wanted, again, to split off to send to the vendor, are the other three automatically approved and sent forward?","NULL"
"195"," Once you approve the order. You have to, after you handle each of your detail line items, however you're going to handle, then you approve the whole order, and that's what  .","NULL"
"196"," , I don't have any experts on. Are they having to...If they approve  item to go  stock, or  , they approve it all, would there be a reason they couldn't approve ? We had that problem with   departmental request...","NULL"
"197","  that's really not an LCAM issue.","NULL"
"198"," So even though they have it, they can't  because they have to wait for the part number available in the item  so they can approve.","NULL"
"199"," I think somebody had made a request. I don't know exactly what it was, but it was something like BMA will just put a status on the order other than approve, and I think  or waiting on  was what they were talking about.","NULL"
"200"," We'll take it back to them  look at the next one  more.","NULL"
"201"," He already covered the split, over here, and stuff we just talked about  if they can't change that source, I don't know what we're doing wrong.","NULL"
"202"," That one, I think, was a misunderstanding. Because she's trying to change it to  , because in  it says the equipment's available but in LCAM, it's already sourced that equipment for another shipment, so it's not available in LCAM. I really think that issue is just confusion over the fact that, that piece of equipment had already been sourced for other orders.","NULL"
"203"," They've got something that...","NULL"
"204"," ...it's wired. It will say quantity allocated  not showing allocated yet.","NULL"
"205"," That's what I think, because we've been only picking up like every 20 minutes or so.","NULL"
"206"," All right, I'll take that back to them.","NULL"
"207"," And if that's not the case, then let me know. If we need to have a little WebX or something, and go through some of this...","NULL"
"208"," That may be an excellent idea.","NULL"
"209"," If they come up with their scenarios, and we can do the WebX...","NULL"
"210"," This situation, we can do this.","NULL"
"211"," I think  to do that  decisions for that. I think there may be more to it, but I think some it is absolutely just confusion.","NULL"
"212"," That's to be expected with a new system. It's different.","NULL"
"213"," In the first week. The first three times you do it.","NULL"
"214"," , that would be best. It doesn't matter when   .","NULL"
"215"," I don't  that.","NULL"
"216"," Yeah. I can do that. It will probably be Wednesday before I can schedule it. I'm pretty booked up. I'll send some...","NULL"
"217","  .","NULL"
"218"," Who all do you want? Or should I just send it to you two, and you all can send it to whoever?","NULL"
"219"," You can just send it to  it doesn't matter, as long as it's  .","NULL"
"220"," OK. All good.","NULL"
"221"," Larry, Karen's concern with the ship via CLLIs, and then the CLLI code that  , we need them. We're working on reviewing that in-house first, OK?","NULL"
"222"," Yeah. I got it.  .","NULL"
"223"," Yeah, I've done that. We're working on where that might be confusing. And the other item, I don't know if we've had it out there before, but the  group, and, well, both groups, I don't know if it's on anything, but CLLI code with the wild card...That's a big request.","F"
"224"," I don't remember that one.","NULL"
"225","  .","NULL"
"226"," Perfect.","NULL"
"227"," Clean it up, there.","NULL"
"228"," Guess it's not  I want to say. I think it is. There's so much on there, as ","NULL"
"229"," Right, and that's generally across any  search criteria. That'd be great.","NULL"
"230"," Ken, Is that mainly when you're trying to search for spares in a cluster location?","NULL"
"231"," I didn't get to read anything, but that would be one of the few reasons.","A"
"234"," Happy.","NULL"
"235"," Said it was  .","NULL"
"236"," Gather up...","NULL"
"238"," On the order approval screen they'd be trying to change to SE for a line item.","NULL"
"239"," Yes.","NULL"
"240"," Drake? Can you see how substitution works in LCAM?","NULL"
"241"," Yeah. As long as it's a valid substitute, you should be able to edit that line item and change the SE, or you can split it, put in a substitute for that particular asset. It has to be in our table for substitutes.","A"
"242"," Why would you split it if it's  ?","NULL"
"243"," We wouldn't unless it...","NULL"
"244"," You wouldn't unless you...","NULL"
"245"," Whenever they can't put that in, they need to let me know what it is, and we can check the sub table to see what's wrong. If it's valid we can update the sub table.","F"
"246"," Going to be a big one, but...","NULL"
"247"," Suckers.","NULL"
"248"," Larry, I guess that covers what we were talking about.","NULL"
"249"," Yeah. Yes, sir.","NULL"
"250"," Then for the IBT group that we were trying to target, most critical thing, what's coming up and biggest holdback is SCC scan error correction screen. First request,  , go to the active logs  . We're finding everything. Narrow those certain criteria. With project-related, OK.","NULL"
"251"," Otherwise they're struggling, fishing through the errors, and I think they're overwhelmed. First of all, we have a lot of errors. They usually have that cleaned up  .","NULL"
"252"," We were talking about different things. There's not an Infinium company, probably that'd come into play. The CLLI code, not only a wild card. There's some code, I'm no expert, I put a underscore four times, a  , 08, then a percent. It'll know that the specific, fixed character was for 08. You know what I'm saying?","NULL"
"253"," Yes.","NULL"
"254"," I can do that.","NULL"
"255"," Have a general  target for their assigned areas  Indiana, Ohio, and  instead of fishing through  .","NULL"
"256"," ...on the list.","NULL"
"257"," If you have other ideas, just to generalize it, that'd be good. The target project, that's OK. That's there, but otherwise they struggle.","NULL"
"258"," You don't look at it. See what it is? It should be just be  .","NULL"
"259"," ...I'm thinking Susan's already got that on the list.","NULL"
"260"," ...that can be brought up before releases, and even without releases. Is there a reprocess feature overnight to take something  ?","NULL"
"261"," Grady, are you on the room?","NULL"
"262"," Yeah, I'm here. Reprocessing from the SCC page?","NULL"
"263"," No. He's talking about...Aren't you talking about whenever we release or whenever we want to, to try to reprocess everything that's in the SCC screen for you?","NULL"
"264"," Yeah. I finished a script recently, was finishing up early this morning, to take all those and get them back to where they'll go through workflow again, reprocess so I can execute that procedure.","NULL"
"265"," Would you like us to run that overnight, Jim?","NULL"
"266"," Yeah, that would be helpful.","NULL"
"267"," I can.","NULL"
"268"," Grady wasn't able to finish for Friday night's release. They were trying to  . He'll run that after about six pm central time today. That should get anything that would have changed in the release and that's still sitting in the FCC screen. That should at least get rid of any of that.","NULL"
"269"," ...a canned query. I can't remember what the title was called, of the report. I'd have to  double check it. She was getting some random results and others were getting good results  query, sensitive to multi, people trying to use it at the same time. The point is that current results were impaired.","NULL"
"270"," They got the same thing two or three times and got different results.","NULL"
"271"," Do you know which report she was running?","NULL"
"272"," I figured you'd ask that, so I'll get back with you on that.","NULL"
"273"," Thanks.","NULL"
"274"," It was on an email but I can't...","NULL"
"275"," I don't want to  , anyway.","NULL"
"276"," It'll take me a minute. If you could give me the date so I can open it up, that's fine.  .","NULL"
"277"," Those are the kind of issues that scare the crap out of me. I know they're trying to use it.","NULL"
"278"," ...promotion screen, at the same time...","NULL"
"279"," 0.999.  91...","NULL"
"280"," ...really not minor. I don't even know. I'm assuming that it's still open.","NULL"
"281"," It is still open. You shouldn't...","NULL"
"282"," Don't want it to get lost.","NULL"
"283"," It is  .","NULL"
"284"," Why are they...?","NULL"
"285"," One last thing.","NULL"
"286"," They'll at least use a CPR code and...","NULL"
"287"," We're getting a lot of calls from the techs, and I've been trying to email. It was 3/11. I am sorry, folks.","NULL"
"288"," Sorry about that,  in my pocket.","NULL"
"289"," I'm scanning transactions, email of March 11. It's not  . Reply  , so there's  question from Nicole and Peggy. They're working on .  getting critical. You need me to forward that email again? You know what I'm talking about?","NULL"
"290"," Yes. I haven't replied to it, and it's old, and I probably moved it. I know last week you and Ken were going to get together about what the roles would need to be for the month's scanning  . That determines what screens they can see. Still send me that email and I'll look at it and see if I can  it.","NULL"
"291","  . Thank you. That'll do it for now.","NULL"
"292"," Get a high level  . Going to pick up a new Verizon 3  Larry, we've got to get that request for approval smoothed out, and get this scanning process correct the errors  down a little bit.","NULL"
"293"," Hopefully the WebX I'll set up for Wednesday will help.","NULL"
"294"," Larry, do you have anything else?","NULL"
"295"," No, sir. I'm good.","NULL"
"296"," That's it for me, too.","NULL"
"297"," Thanks, everybody. Hope you...","NULL"
"298"," Well, Susan's on her way to the large. Do we need to catch her?","NULL"
"299"," Yeah, because I mean it's 3:30.","NULL"
"300"," Susan is right.","NULL"
"301"," Who is this, Joy?","NULL"
"302"," It's Kaitlin.","NULL"
"303"," Hey, Kaitlin.","NULL"
"304"," Hi Greg. It's all the rest of your friends.","NULL"
"305"," Not all of them.","NULL"
"306"," ","NULL"
"307"," OK, Jim, Kaitlin, Kim, I think, and DJ.","NULL"
"308"," OK, this important thing about the meeting is sent an email saying what was going to be in the release tonight, so you'll be getting the release tonight. What else do we need to talk about?","NULL"
"309"," I just have one thing. This is Adam. I did get the list of fans from Brian. I haven't started working on those, but I did get those recently, so I'll start working on getting those resolved.","NULL"
"310"," All right. Thanks.","NULL"
"311"," Feel great things.","NULL"
"312"," Great things they were better than that.","NULL"
"313"," OK, Anybody else have any updates?","NULL"
"314","  It's hilarious that they're in there.","NULL"
"315"," It's a lot...a little bit ago what you're doing with the Thursdays?  Did Kim even join?","NULL"
"316"," I thought I heard Kim, but,  sure who did join.","NULL"
"317"," Yeah, it is...I always hear them on calls .","NULL"
"318"," I don't know. Every time I hear Kim I think of the girl sort of like...I've never heard it as a man's name before.","NULL"
"319"," OK I will let you know that... I'll just let you know that one of the folks that is supporting our virtual server advised us that it appears there's a possibility that the application could be using reports and not releasing them.","NULL"
"320"," We're not saying that that's happening, so the thing now is doing that today. put a monitor on those codes just so that he can see that they're being released. Other than that, he was not able to find out what, if there was a network issue, it was. Before we can root cause it so it doesn't happen again, I wanted to make sure that it's not a port issue, so he's taking care of that.","NULL"
"321"," And that's all I have.","NULL"
"322"," All right. We will talk to you guys tomorrow.","NULL"
"323"," It records. It's red. It records  and you can plug it in here and it will search all your notes. It can take it up.","NULL"
"324"," Seriously?","NULL"
"325"," Mm-hm. Look at the paper. It's super cool.","NULL"
"326"," This is works?","NULL"
"327"," When you push record, it starts recording what you write, and there's a little camera in here, and it picks up the things that...","NULL"
"328"," Are you serious?","NULL"
"329"," Yeah, I'm completely serious. I have, what, 73 pages since I came here? I'll probably fill it up by the time I leave. Then I can remember because I'm not doing my research stuff for the data analysis until October, so I need to remember everything I can remember. It's really cool. I didn't use it at first, and then I was like, ""I should try it."" My handwriting is terrible. Look at that. It picks it up. It's fantastic.","NULL"
"330"," It is. It's really cool.","NULL"
"331"," It's super awesome. I didn't buy it. I made Notre Dame buy it. I was like...","NULL"
"332"," ...made. Before we go, we'll figure it out and get the best of the usual releases. Conduit...","NULL"
"333"," What about that? ","NULL"
"334"," We got in a request that's, as per usual, something that needs to be done within the next month so I asked them what they wanted to push out and pretty much Conduit with The Elite. A way of possibilities so we'll be replacing MAT point and configurable palette with the MAT powders. Adam and Miranda are given at the best in Michael's help. I already told them the Conduit stuff, we just have a slot for them.","NULL"
"335"," ","NULL"
"336"," Well, get started on it. I'd say go ahead, but until we have the meeting happening.","NULL"
"337"," If we get a meeting  .","NULL"
"338"," Yes, if we can get the meeting and get stories. If Patrick has time again with the performance issue, any type thing, and you're becoming familiar with it then that's great.  , customer support?","NULL"
"339"," That's open.","NULL"
"340"," And, then Frontier. So can you all get together and get Frontier scheduled for  ?","NULL"
"341"," We want them scheduled like April the fourth, right? That's that Monday?","NULL"
"342"," April fourth or  .","NULL"
"343"," Can you add the PUD and the sub power on the northwest engine of that database? I honestly keep forgetting to do it.","NULL"
"344"," Can you remember when we get down to that thing?","NULL"
"345"," I think we're on that section. I want them to be trained.","NULL"
"346"," Got you.","NULL"
"347"," I want them to be listed as a group, those three companies to be trained on Front Desk. That and PUD and the sub powering on the northwest engine. Jesse, when you get to that, then I'll give you the contact names. I don't have them off the top of my head.","NULL"
"348"," You need to talk to  . We have residents there to notify people. We need to get him on board. OK, we have decided on the Agile Class, and I am gonna get it scheduled based on everybody's calenders. John wanted us to bring a couple of the Denver people in. Talked to Matt yesterday about trying to make sure it all works with their calenders, as well. We are going do a one day class. It will probably be late April, early May would be my guess.","NULL"
"349"," Where would that be, then?","NULL"
"350"," Here?","NULL"
"351"," Well I think the question is are the people...","NULL"
"352"," I just saw the number of people.","NULL"
"353"," Here we are...","NULL"
"354"," It's going to be our team, Jules' team, and then a couple guys from Denver. So we can open that up. We'll figure out how to do it.","NULL"
"355"," OK, HTML file  .","NULL"
"356"," I've asked  for these flashback construction engineering. I told them engineering is done, and, construction, I told them we're not planning on doing anything this quarter.","NULL"
"357"," At least not  .","NULL"
"358"," They were supposed to get together and talk back with me but they haven't yet, so whatever. All right, Frontier?","NULL"
"359"," It's awesome!","NULL"
"360"," What's the real story?","NULL"
"361"," We're probably going to have another emergency release tonight around, I'd say, 7:00 or 8:00. How many days passed? ","NULL"
"362"," Presently, those release counters, how many business days have we...","NULL"
"363"," That's exactly...close one, because we did not do one on Monday. We did one on Sunday, didn't do it on Monday. We did one Sunday with every business position.","NULL"
"364"," There will be nothing to worry about right now.","NULL"
"365"," We really messed with Paige's report. Seems like being every bad day out there with all the sudden releases.","NULL"
"366"," Not very happy about it. What about the people for that date?","NULL"
"367"," Apparently, we're going to be converting those assets at some time on Saturday, April the 2nd over Verizon. As far as where the rest of the release is, Drake's trying to not have email up, and get his work done for the release and quit working on emergency releases. He's trying to keep it down so that he can get caught up. Everybody else, I guess, is on track. Nobody said they were stuck.","NULL"
"368"," There's no way you could  . 30,000 locations have fallen out right now.","NULL"
"369"," Are they answering your questions?","NULL"
"370"," Just so we are clear, your stuff is what you get done by April 2nd. After that it becomes their stuff, unless they decide to push after release. I know that's not the best possible solution we can turn over, but that's the one that they had given us. If they refuse to push that day, and they say they'll handle the fallout. There we go. Karen?","NULL"
"371"," I can't read the  . Whole transfer stuff...as far as I know we are on track for delivering at the end of the month, their go by date. Right now is April 4th. I do have some questioning on reports. They didn't give me four reports that they want. There's not a whole lot of detail in there. They said they need this before we go live.","NULL"
"372"," I'm meeting with Des, I think tomorrow, on those reports. That's our top priority from them. Des keeps working on that. We're meeting with them Thursday again, so they can decide what option they want to go with. So we can make progress on that. That will not meet the 31st day period. There's no way that's going to happen.","NULL"
"373"," But we did tell her that yesterday.","NULL"
"374"," Yes, we did.","NULL"
"375"," The sooner we know things are going to meet dates,  the better we can set expectations to them.","NULL"
"376"," The Dashboard is done, as far as I'm concerned.","NULL"
"377"," Are you sure? Nobody  today.","NULL"
"378"," Yes. Kevin's been writing those stories. We have a meeting probably Sunday, so  test cases.  . Then we have the planning  early this week or next week, it may not be this week. Sometime next week it should be done  , as far as the whole thing goes, hopefully.","NULL"
"379","  Marcy has sent questions over to the engineers, basically in charge of the engineering request. I guess we'll make an emergency release for that report. I'm talking about this...then we've talked about this sustainment team. We've loosely got Jasmine and Miranda as the sustainment team right now.","NULL"
"380"," Miranda we've kind of pulled off a little bit, to work on this emergency one month, mapping things with Adam. Right now Jasmine is the sustainment team. We just had a meeting with United Illuminating, because they had a bunch of tickets kind of following...Karen's got a bunch of schedule work to do.","NULL"
"381"," The whole point of this sustainment team-creating is to try to limit the distractions and do our schedule part. What we said out of this...we had that meeting. Joel and Karen ran it, talked to the customer and asked questions back and forth. What we really want is Jesse and Jasmine running that meeting.","NULL"
"382"," The tickets come in to Jesse, if he can't figure it out, if it's a coding thing, something that needs to be looked at in the code, questions that he has, or things that need to be configured. Then he would go to the sustainment team, and then they're able to look into the code, probably make some database changes. At first they're going to have a lot of questions, so we will be subject matter experts that they'll go to.","NULL"
"383"," So they might schedule a 10, 15 minute question and answer session where they will write down...so we won't have to sit there keeping notes, managing it all, making sure it all gets done, making sure the tickets get resolved -- that'll be the sustainment team responsibility -- we'll just be there answering questions. So they'll ask the questions, write down the answers, update the tickets, and then we just...obviously at first they're going to have a lot of questions to us about how things work. So that will be our responsibility right now, just to answer those questions.","NULL"
"384"," Then as we move on into maybe some people roll on onto that team  that'll allow him to ask people in other applications questions so we'll all work through this cross-training opportunity.  . Do we have?","NULL"
"385"," We had some stuff that Jasmine did and we haven't released it yet, a couple of things we found, new items, we're fixing the other two. Jeremy's CTL needs to be added on that list too. That has the same thing, there were some things that were...","NULL"
"386"," checking everything she did   .","NULL"
"387"," ...put over there too, I don't know what they are off the top of my head.","NULL"
"388"," Do I need to be notified? Releases?","NULL"
"389"," No.","NULL"
"390"," I don't know, let's...","NULL"
"391"," 1.20 is the one that's going out at the end of the month.","NULL"
"392"," ","NULL"
"393"," Based on what new tech 1.10 out on, that is...","NULL"
"394"," ","NULL"
"395"," 1.20 might need to be moved up some depending on what option they take on the fast path. That's the one having to get it checked in. I guess we owe him that with a clean release so we may go with 20 a little bit earlier.","NULL"
"396"," The HTML files will be the release and then we'll work it like an Agile thing where if we have an emergency release or one month release, there might be things that are doable and releaseable, to production during that thing, and this thing of a couple of releases, I guess, probably.","NULL"
"397"," Today what I did was -- for this meeting -- sometimes I hear the complaint throughout the years that people don't know what other people are doing. So today, rather than staying on track off track, I kind of had everybody give a little bit more color to the things so you all can let me know if you like that or don't like that. That way at least we all kind of know what's going on, and what's coming and what's in range, and whatever people are working on. I'm sorry that's as far as it goes. One minute.","NULL"
"398"," So we're going to do this upgrade to TFS. I think the upgrade is 2015, then we can hire Paige to come in for a couple of weeks and let everything go forwards.","NULL"
"399"," I think that'll be very helpful to run on  ...we'll just still  higher, for that one, and then...","NULL"
"400"," OK so I want...we always say this and everybody gets locked up in their day to day, I would like everyone in this room to submit something by next week  , just an idea, just anything that they're interested in technology-wise, that will force us all to...if you don't have anything pressing, at least it'll get the brain ticking a little bit about, ""Hey, what might I be interested in?""","NULL"
"401"," Because you know, we do have this core value about being driven and wanting to grow and wanting to expand our knowledge in anything I guess, and I guess it doesn't necessarily have to be  , you could just be technology thing, it could be application thing, it could be ""I want to know more about how nuts and bolts and  works."" Whatever.","NULL"
"402"," I want to get lunch, something to eat if you want me to  . It can be anybody.","NULL"
"403"," We've got a lot of knowledge in this room so we just want to take advantage of that. I would like every single person to submit something. I would say go into the spread sheet and just put your idea down here somewhere. I've created an ideas tab on here so everybody can just go put your idea on the ideas tab this week.","NULL"
"404"," OK, set-up time for new hires, for training classes. I think Jesse's coming to work in a bit with...","NULL"
"405"," I know, he said  .","NULL"
"406"," Yeah. He's been unofficially now. We'll get a target and more formalized, with this on-boarding process. I want to talk to Brandon and Jasmine and get their input, Paige I guess as well, about what could we do better. I met with you guys a little bit about this same thing.","NULL"
"407"," All right, so we took a little bit more time today talking about the status of where everything's at. Does anybody have any issues or anything that we can take off of this list? I guess it decreases every time, those tabs.","NULL"
"408"," Does anybody else need...I know Susan,  and Jesse are the...","NULL"
"409","  .","NULL"
"410"," OK. Does anybody feel the need to do a formal touch-base on the ticketing process?","NULL"
"411","  and I would like a refresher, since it's been a few months since she showed us how to do it.","NULL"
"412"," Yeah, some new members. I think we need a refresher course.","NULL"
"413"," We'll set that up.","NULL"
"414"," What is the set up that today  would go for support fails, they need access really to  pick up some of the support, and so I asked Kevin about it, and of course they don't want to send us the  , so how are we going to analyse  because we don't want to have to give mainframe access for everybody  .","NULL"
"415"," Be able to keep  to be able to discuss that, make sure that we're good, legally, or to  .","NULL"
"416"," On the support thing, when work stoppage issues come through and it's during the day, can we assume that you will get in touch with the right person, so I can delete that email until...","NULL"
"417"," You can just take your name off the list  .","NULL"
"418"," ...if someone gets...","NULL"
"419"," every time one comes in   ...","NULL"
"420"," Do I need to look at it?","NULL"
"421"," ...the handling goes and that's why I always  ...","NULL"
"422"," Only reason why I left you two on the list of people that get notified is like what if I'm sick that day.","NULL"
"423"," That's fine. If I can assume you will get to the right person, I will delete it, unless you're out of the office.","NULL"
"424"," Here's what I would prefer is if we did...When you have it, if you can send a reply to the big blue  . Whoever's got it, everybody also knows, because you know it's just like that  people, then likely nobody's doing  .","NULL"
"425"," ""Hey, I have it,"" type thing.","NULL"
"426"," Yeah, or the opposite of that is three people will be looking at the same thing. I would like a, ""Hey, we got it,"" type thing. I don't know what's the best way to do that. Maybe you go ahead and change the ticket  if you could do that, as soon as you're looking at it.","NULL"
"427"," I could just do some kind of a standardized thing, like we've received a ticket and we'll provide an update when we have more...Just something like that, to know that I've actually seen it  that response  the ticket. It can be something as simple as that.","NULL"
"428"," Just some way that so we'll know  you're not here, then I'll probably handle one of them.","NULL"
"429"," I don't know that you're not here now since I'm not always there.","NULL"
"430"," Anything else?  .","NULL"
"431"," I forgot what it was.","NULL"
"432"," to add, is there anything you want to ask or talk about  or suggest? I know right now we're still making  so the process changes and trying to hold on  process changes and also that we've touched a lot of issues  . I had you all feeling good on the HTML file as far as this iteration   .","NULL"
"433"," Can you put in something that  I don't think anyone has decided on how they want it to be laid out yet. That's the last I heard.","NULL"
"434"," Writing?","NULL"
"435"," Pardon?","NULL"
"436"," Writing? You're writing  .","NULL"
"437"," Me?","NULL"
"438"," Yeah, 1 through 10.","NULL"
"439"," No.","NULL"
"440"," I already a  .","NULL"
"441"," How long ago?","NULL"
"442"," Who's next?","NULL"
"443","   .","NULL"
"444"," Eight.","NULL"
"445","  I'm trying to understand...","NULL"
"446"," About the...? OK.","NULL"
"447","  throw some numbers.","NULL"
"448"," Just the effectiveness of it, the point in writing it is to try get more vision in the meeting and try to make sure that things are useful, the information is useful, that we're not wasting time, that we're solving issues. Right now, I've got the meeting schedule, so sure, there's difficult-to-solve issues.","NULL"
"449"," My hope out of this is that we raise issues and then that we can form little teams together to try to solve the issues as we go and get all that stuff on the table, and then to give information to everybody, since a lot of people  complained about not knowing what everybody else is working on, things like that. Just giving a little color of what everybody's working on.","NULL"
"450"," addressing all the concerns we have   .","NULL"
"451"," Yeah, addressing the concerns and just letting everybody  .","NULL"
"452"," necessarily address those, upgrade and have triage   .","NULL"
"453"," If I see a bunch sixes or sevens or something or a bunch of tens and somebody uses a seven, then it's like, ""Why is it?"" and then try to address what the concern is. So like Patrick in  , what would make it better than a seven?","NULL"
"454"," Knocking some stuff off the list. It is helpful. It is generally good, but not has been better or worse than the other. We've started knocking stuff off the list and maybe  get more fuzzy  .","NULL"
"455"," I've got the same concerns. It seems like we  , but not much is getting rubbed off.","NULL"
"456"," I think that it's probably a good idea to go ahead and make it 45 minutes. I think we can use the extra 15 minutes. I try to start small, see what we can get done, but it seems like...That's always my issues, too, when I was managing things, knocking things off.","NULL"
"457"," I gave it an eight today instead of a seven because we did add and take a couple things off and put things on the to-do list. We talked about the support thing. We didn't solve anything big, but at least we made a little bit of progress.","NULL"
"458"," There was one thing you mentioned earlier on, TFS 2013, and so that  pops up in my head. The simple solution  in 2012, Frontier we're on 2013, are we going to...?","NULL"
"459"," Everything would be on the same.","NULL"
"460"," Are we?","NULL"
"461"," Yeah  where all of our products are  .","NULL"
"462"," We're going by TFS where everything is and everything can do that well right now. I've got my Visual Studio.","NULL"
"463"," I'm talking Visual Studio. We need to  .","NULL"
"464"," We can actually put that...","NULL"
"465"," ...so that you're all  .","NULL"
"466"," That's the kind of thing that we want to capture, put on the issues log and  .","NULL"
"467"," I don't think it's a to-do yet, because I don't think we're at a point to do it. I think we're going to have to figure out how we're going to do it, because we have at least three right now. We have 2010, 2012 and 2013. I think it needs some discussion around strategy to do it first, before it becomes a to-do, and then once we do that then it could be something to do, someone actually doing it.","NULL"
"468"," That's all...anything else  .","NULL"
"469"," I'm getting a little loopy.","NULL"
"470"," Very well. Understood. That's for sure.","NULL"
"471"," It's a lot of emails I've gone through. I've gone through more in the last two weeks than ever in a two week time span. OK. Did you all have anything specific you wanted to talk about?","NULL"
"472"," Speaking of emails. Earlier in the week, Susan, I sent you an email about location groups.","NULL"
"473","  I haven't gotten back to that one yet. I do remember reading it...Stop it!","NULL"
"474"," Slacker.","NULL"
"475"," Slacker? That's me. Goofing off. I'll find out the answers and get them to you.","NULL"
"476"," Thank you. Would that be related to the ICP clusters?","NULL"
"477"," Yeah. I know Peggy and I talked about it, because she was working on some documentation and had a few questions  sent on to Susan.","NULL"
"478"," One of Larry's group  was wondering...I don't know, I hope it's in an email about, I think Susan or somebody explained you could  location groups, or there wasn't an opportunity to do global ones. We need to get those clusters back in, or started.","NULL"
"479"," Anything else that we need to talk about?","NULL"
"480"," Jim, do you have anything else?","NULL"
"481"," No, I'm good.","NULL"
"482"," So, Jim, the last email that Brian sent in regards to those CLLIs that we can't match as an exchange? I know we're getting down to the wire. I don't think that Ken and I can weigh in on that, as to what he wants to do.","A"
"483"," I've got it open, here. That was one of my two things, so I'll jump to that one. Yeah, Brian...Let's see, where are we? The company plant couldn't find a CLLI code.","F"
"486"," Actually, a different email  . Ship this one.","NULL"
"487"," It was probably...It kind of looks like it. I did just company, plant at first. Then I tried company, plant, and zip code. I got a little bit better results with that. There's still the company, plant combination either doesn't exist in the CLLIs that exist in those network element files, or the combination yields too many...There's not a distinct exchange, otherwise, for that combination.","NULL"
"488"," What are you bouncing off of? I don't know.","NULL"
"489"," There was three files. DJ, would probably be better to chime in on this one.","NULL"
"490"," It was network elements, Jim, that I was provided by Cathy Johns. I gave him those three documents that match. It was network elements and the OAC. The other one was asset accounting. Do you want a copy of them?","NULL"
"491"," Asset accounting?","NULL"
"492"," Asset accounting was the OAC and the...","NULL"
"493"," OK. No. Let me just back up then. That's good enough to get me started to help. I know that it's critical, seeing what we missed. In my explanation, I'd say, is there any way to take that company plant, that you said we figured was buried in that, through those CLLI codes?","NULL"
"494"," Use that company plant to first map to the CLLI six of the  key data? Oh, so you did do that.","NULL"
"495"," Yes.","NULL"
"496"," With that, you'd have to go over to Cathy Johns, OK.","NULL"
"497"," Right.","NULL"
"498"," That doesn't make sense. I'm not questioning you but...","NULL"
"499"," I totally understand.","NULL"
"500","  . You're saying for company plant combination, like in California, 9WC whatever plan code, that could come to us, there's multiple CLLI sixes? Leave out the building?","NULL"
"501"," Not necessarily different CLLI sixes, but those CLLI sixes didn't have the state exchange codes.","NULL"
"502"," Really?","NULL"
"503"," Yeah.","NULL"
"504"," These don't look like anything I've ever seen before, so Ken and I were talking about it, and...","NULL"
"505"," So, I'm scared to do anything on these, because I don't want there to be bad accounting data on there, but I also don't want them to fall out, either. Could I maybe take the most popular exchange code out of the...? That's kind of almost a quirky,  thing to do, and I feel like exactly like what Susan motioned to do, like I'm kind of throwing a dart.","NULL"
"506"," DJ, if I pull up 9WC0201, you're going to get a long list of company plants, different sub plants, and you're going to get some valid CLLI codes, and invalid ones. To me, an exchange boundary  like Marion, Ohio added one exchange, and then small little remotes off of Marion, it's the same exchange. I thought the exchange was a broader, defining area, so I was hoping.","NULL"
"507"," It sounds like that didn't work. What did we do with the net pseudos?","NULL"
"508"," That was the lowly thing about net, is that each of the pseudos itself had the company code on there. In the net table itself, the CO profile table, there was that Infinium company code OAC in exchange field for each record.","NULL"
"509"," That's because we went in and cleaned those up prior to passing the data to you.","NULL"
"510"," Which is going to be more difficult, and probably impossible to do in this case, because you could probably clean them up  extract 4, but then when we get the next extract, then there's going to be more stuff in there, potentially, that we haven't even considered. It would be nice if we had more broader swath.","NULL"
"511"," I like Jim's rules, that mindset of, if we had CLLI six, we could map it to an exchange that way. That was incredibly beneficial. It's just it's not fully working.","NULL"
"512"," Don't you all have to, or somebody have to map these CLLIs to Infinium?","NULL"
"513"," The pseudo ones?","NULL"
"514"," Yeah. Or do they not use the pseudos in Infinium?","NULL"
"515"," Like Ken said, in net we already clean them up, so yeah, we'll eventually have to map them to Infinium.","NULL"
"516"," No, I mean for Infinium to go live with this Verizon data in April, doesn't somebody have to map this stuff? I don't understand.","NULL"
"517"," They'll map it by...I'll check with the Infinium folks.","NULL"
"518"," DJ, I know you haven't said this directly, but isn't some of the work that the IT department is going to be doing on this data before we get it, some of the work that they have to do so that Infinium will have their information on that, to the Verizon...?","NULL"
"519"," I said, I didn't finish my thought. Now remember, in Infinium, they don't even look at the CLLI code.  thing, so they're just looking at the company plant, sub plant, and going by the CO code and business unit. They're defining it that way. So, Infinium doesn't even look at these pseudo-CLLIs or CLLIs. Go ahead, DJ, I interrupted you to answer the other part.","NULL"
"520"," I just wanted to clarify.","NULL"
"521"," No, that's good.","NULL"
"522"," Pulling it in  , it's like you said. This doesn't have anything to do with the CLLIs, but, you'd think there was something that we could match it up with.","NULL"
"523"," Those three digits, let me send out another file, but, those three digits that have  from the very top, if you look at 225WC, the does WC stand for wire center? Or not?","NULL"
"524"," She told me about...","NULL"
"525"," No, it was out in California. 9WC was the company code.","NULL"
"526"," Since the Infinium folks are going to have to deal with this, probably on the case-by-case basis as they encounter the new sub plants, I assume, could we put maybe a placeholder on these that we can't figure out and get them in that way? And then they could be dealt with on the case-by-case basis as they get encountered in LCAM? Is that a possibility?","NULL"
"527"," That's a good question. Ken, we need to get with Sarah, I think,  she's got to go into Infinium anyway, and fixed assets, so we should be able to get those exchanges.","NULL"
"528","  . The data that she sent to you...","NULL"
"529"," So if that's true, then we could probably just come up with a pattern, like Drake said, of an exchange code. Because the exchange code helps me link back to that other file that DJ gave me that had that exhaustive list of LACs and company codes. I've had not a single problem matching up the exchange codes I've found back to that list, so I think that's perfect there.","NULL"
"530"," The only thing that I would need to put in there would be a place holder for the exchange code, the company code, and the OAC. If we just came up with some sort of thing that, it's blatantly obvious to whoever's using that part of LCAM, goes, ""Oh, yeah, I know I need to do this when I come across this,"" then that would at least get  through this part to the next thing.","NULL"
"531"," So, if that's OK with you guys, I'll just...we'll figure out what looks good based on the data that we've got and email that to you guys. You can either say, ""Yeah I like that,"" or ""No, I don't like that, go back, dummy and go try it again,"" and we'll try it again.","NULL"
"532"," Yeah, sounds good.","NULL"
"533"," Jim, did you say you had two items on your list?","NULL"
"534"," Ken, are you OK with that? DJ.","NULL"
"535"," Yeah. That sounds like a good solution, short term, to me.","NULL"
"537"," It was quite a while ago, and to be honest, it could have been you that said it or somebody else. Neither here nor there. That's the next barrier I'm coming across, is I need to know whether or not the G team's ship-to code is indeed a valid ship-to code for those locations that are in the extract. If they are, I'll need those addresses. I really just don't know where to find them, if they are in the extract or not.","F"
"538"," If they're not, I need to strip those out, but we'd also need to know whether we can or can't ship a plug to one of those particular locations, and if something needs to go there, where it needs to be shipped to, via, to get there.","A"
"539"," I hesitate to pull NetLogic out, because it seems to me like it'd be a mess if it got into LCAM without a via location specified, and somebody tried to ship something directly to someplace in the middle of nowhere.","NULL"
"540"," That seems like that would be a worse problem to clean up than the alternative, but I can do whatever you guys feel is the better of the two evils. If we can't get the ship-to's in time, that is. I know you're relying on somebody else to get us that information, I just...","NULL"
"541"," I've got a call in to  . I guess I can call again. Everybody's busy who's on call. So Ken, if we didn't have a ship-to via on some of these, I think you're going to be...I don't even know what we would ship to those pseudos.","NULL"
"542"," We probably aren't shipping to them, but I'm not sure all the intricacies between  and G teams, and how G teams was handling that. I haven't looked at the G teams data, either. Brian, have you been looking at the G teams data?","NULL"
"543"," I don't know where to find it, to be honest.","NULL"
"544"," OK. ","NULL"
"545"," I saw the reference to it, and I'm not seeing any foreign key constraints to another table from the ice locations table, but I haven't looked...","NULL"
"546"," Most of these didn't have constraints, I think. I think they had interfaces built between separate databases. DJ, should I do some digging into G teams?","NULL"
"547"," Let me ask somebody over at the Verizon land the question. That way, you don't have to waste your time if I can get some information.","NULL"
"548"," That would be of help. Thank you.","NULL"
"549"," You're very welcome.","NULL"
"550"," So, is the option on the via ship-to...Can that also just have a filler that would prompt others to react to it?","NULL"
"551"," Can we just put a pseudo-pseudo...","NULL"
"552"," Pseudo-pseudo.","NULL"
"553"," I'm starting to feel out of conception here, but a pseudo-pseudo CLLI, that we put as the via location for all of the ones that have a via location, and that can be the place holder, then go, ""Oh, I need to figure out where to ship this to,"" and we could have that as a dummy address, maybe? I don't know what that would look like, but, something.","NULL"
"554"," Would they all be the same? Pseudo-pseudo?","NULL"
"555"," Yeah. Every G team ship code that we have, we would just map it to alpha.","NULL"
"556"," Ship unknown or something like that. Load base alpha  .","NULL"
"557"," Yeah, we can try that, Jim.","NULL"
"558"," What do you think, Ken? DJ?","NULL"
"559"," We can't find any real data that would at least get the records transferred in without fallout.","NULL"
"560"," That'd be good, as long as there's something there and we know we've got to go back to it.  target. What we have for  logistics is  ship to  .","NULL"
"561"," Yeah. They should have those, right?","NULL"
"562"," Yeah. I need to get back with them. I haven't sent any replies. Plus, he didn't call me back.","NULL"
"563"," That did bring me to another question. I can't find warehouses in the data at all, and I know that, Ken, we got feedback from you to look at the building type field that's there, and that was beneficial. We found the field locations, and may denote it as CS, which I assume is Central Stock. RDC Remote Distribution Center, and then I think an IDC is an Intermediate Distribution Center.","NULL"
"564"," The CSs, the HCSs, and I think the RDPs even, RDCs, and net we treated as forward stocking locations, and we had a static list of CLLIs that we knew to be warehouses. But I don't have a static list or anything like that for the Verizon ones.","NULL"
"565"," I looked at non-working to working plug ratios, and I noticed that the central stock ones, or the building type designating them as central stock locations, had pretty much zero percent working plugs, which sounded to me like it could be either a warehouse or a forward stocking location.","NULL"
"566"," But their FRCs were like 357C, so that didn't sound like a warehouse to me. I did find...","NULL"
"567"," Go ahead, I'm sorry.","NULL"
"568"," Well I know...To cut in there, I just found out not too long ago that Verizon changed their policy on reuse items. They are leaving the capital account. I just wanted to let you know that those 357Cs, that was reused stuff.  .","NULL"
"569"," I did find several locations that seemed to be where the primary account was, a 12, 20, 6, 10, which is the new, right? One of them was the RDC, which was in there, which looked like it was grapevine...Something like that.","NULL"
"570"," But, there were also several other references to assets to locations that seemed to be where the primary account was 12, 20, 6, 10, and those locations didn't exist in the ice locations table. It almost sounds like those could be warehouses, but they didn't exist in the warehouse table.","NULL"
"571"," All right. Let me...  a Verizon call, and I don't know if I have all the emails that he had requested, all the special warehouses. Let me see if I can find that. Grapevine, and  , and there were a couple others. I think that...","NULL"
"572"," I've monopolized the time  , but I think that's pretty much all I had.","NULL"
"573"," We don't have to go into detail on this, but  said to try to work those shipments, and I don't know if you saw the email. Today at 11:00 AM Eastern Time. Would have been 10, 11. Go into it now,  .","NULL"
"574"," What is the problem of the shipment? What exactly was in the email? I can probably find it...","NULL"
"575"," The shipment of...","NULL"
"576"," Is this the one about the projects?","NULL"
"577"," You're cutting out. Or I am.","NULL"
"578"," Sorry.","NULL"
"579"," No, go ahead. You were cutting out, I couldn't hear.","NULL"
"580"," Is this the one about the projects being wrong on the shipments?","NULL"
"581"," Yeah.","NULL"
"582"," We were just looking at that before we got on the call with you guys, so I should be able to give you an update tomorrow once we finish looking at it.","NULL"
"583"," Thanks.","NULL"
"584"," Sure. Is there anything else?","NULL"
"585"," No, not here.","NULL"
"586"," No.","NULL"
"587"," All right. Thanks, everybody. We'll talk to you guys later.","NULL"
"588"," Thank you. Bye.","NULL"
"589"," DJ seems peppy.","NULL"
"590"," Is it her Friday, too?","NULL"
"591"," What am I working on today, the LCAM? What we'll be working on for the next meeting, the LCAM. What do I need from who? Nothing, issues,  can go away. Thanks. ","NULL"
"592"," Been working on more of the elements and stuff. I've looked over Jasmine's page, and then I've been doing help file stuff for current notifying. What about you, Mahesh?","NULL"
"593"," I've been working on login page.","NULL"
"594"," Login page? What are you working on? Jasmine pretty much has it done.","NULL"
"595"," The same page. I'm working on whatever she's working on, business studio. It's different. I think I got the files from the notify library. They keep on changing them  .","NULL"
"596"," A little bit.","NULL"
"597"," A bit, so sometimes we  because what I am doing, is I am downloading from there and pasting on the desktop and working there. So the names, everything, is changing from  .","NULL"
"598"," That's annoying.","NULL"
"599"," I think the collaboration with Jasmine is not working as expected  . Today I can show you that.","NULL"

"601"," I need to also be working on the changing of the icons for the notify  .","NULL"
"602"," For the tiles.","NULL"
"603"," We really need to set up a  repository or something that we can work from so that we're not running into these issues, and so that you're not working from your desktop and using old files.","NULL"
"604","  .","NULL"
"605"," Jasmine threw it all out to TFS i think, from the  . It's terrible.","NULL"
"606"," Is it in TFS now?","NULL"
"607"," I think so. I'm not 100 percent sure.","NULL"
"608"," But we still have the source code that needs to go in TFS?","NULL"
"609"," Yeah, we don't have that. I'm just talking about the stories. So you're talking about putting all of our files there?","NULL"
"610"," That would be good to do.","NULL"
"611","  Jasmine...","NULL"
"612"," Should be in charge of doing that...","NULL"
"613"," I just need a half hour with somebody to think about this because we're going to need to  . Probably enter  notify half. We're going to be on that, on that release cycle. There's going to be some issues with that when I start plugging-up the APIs. All that's under Titan.","NULL"
"614"," We don't want to make this a configuration nightmare for developers to go in.","NULL"
"615"," Who do you need to sit down with?","NULL"
"616"," Somebody.","NULL"
"617"," What is the question?","NULL"
"618"," It doesn't matter.","NULL"
"619"," I just need to bounce ideas off somebody.","NULL"
"620"," What are you talking about?","NULL"
"621"," Source control and putting everything in TFS. All of our files and everything. Right now, we're working off of  two, people are working on their desktop and files are getting written. We're not using the same stuff.","NULL"
"622"," Stuff is breaking. It shouldn't be.","NULL"
"623"," My note is, can we notify? We can probably add to the notify solution. We haven't had the solution upgraded since  the project  .","NULL"
"624"," You could probably cue Karen on this.  a release manager.","NULL"
"625"," I don't know who the release manager is.","NULL"
"626"," It needs one.","NULL"
"627"," Agreed.","NULL"
"628"," It needs to start getting on integrations and  . I need to show Karen what they did. Whether or not she's able to show up and put much into it and see.","NULL"

"663"," Only the view training schedule is going to be available, but it's not showing up there.","NULL"
"664"," How did that end up?","NULL"
"665"," Darryl didn't want the training stuff to be available to users outside of being logged in, because he said that our competitors could just go and see what you could do with notify without...","NULL"
"666","  customers.","NULL"
"667"," He didn't want the help files available from the home page. Or from the login page, rather. Until you've logged in.","NULL"
"668"," I disagree with that.","NULL"
"669"," Why do you disagree with that?","NULL"
"670"," Because it's like a sales tool. Our competitors can get there if they want to get there.","NULL"
"671"," I guess they could just create a fake account.","NULL"
"672"," It's on there now.","NULL"
"673"," Yeah, but he wants it gone now.","NULL"

"679"," Yep.","NULL"
"680"," I'll have the discussion with him and then  . Ultimately it's, we can decide whether or not we want to do that. It's a landing page for something that people that are interested in knowing what it is will be going to.","NULL"
"681"," I mean, as far as we can...","NULL"
"682"," Freaking paranoia, worried about  .","NULL"
"683"," Couldn't somebody just register with a fake account and get all the information anyway?","NULL"
"684"," Not really. When they register their account, we give the company access. Then they have to register as part of the company. Until we say this company is there...Someone can go in and say, ""I'm with one of these other companies.""","NULL"
"685"," But if they don't have an email address matching the domain, then somebody from that company has to validate them. It's a little bit.","NULL"
"686"," OK.","NULL"
"687"," It may be that...Maybe we end up with a different link when you're not logged in. Even if you're a valid user, PHI doesn't want some competitor of theirs looking at their processes, but they want to be able to see them too.","NULL"

"767"," That's true, I mean it's like the chaos. If people don't understand that there's chaos, they freak out. If people understand that it's chaos, and it's organized chaos, they're OK with it.","NULL"
"768"," I believe that.","NULL"
"769"," Are you saying me sending out the list is that we make it organized chaos?","NULL"
"770"," That's perfect. I know my issue has been recognized.","NULL"
"771"," Well, that's what I was trying to give them. It's like, I'm not ignoring these. I've got them on the list. Some of them I've got on the list because we still need to research them, because I don't know if they're an issue or not, or it's just something that they did wrong, then I need to tell them here's the correct way to do that.","NULL"
"772"," I dare you one day to just kind of add a fourth digit to it.","NULL"
"773"," 1268  .","NULL"
"774","  frame.","NULL"
"775"," I was going to say like a million  73 years old.","NULL"
"776"," Even worse, really high. See if anybody notices. I might do that, now that you said that  . Whenever I get to the 90s, instead of it being issue number 90 it will be like 92.  Or something.","NULL"
"777"," 700.","NULL"
"778"," Just start going backwards. This is issue number two on the list or make it three.","NULL"
"779"," In one of them I sent out, I don't remember if I left it or not, but I had put on there, that the issue number does not indicate priority,  because it doesn't. When I say it's issue number 88, that doesn't mean anything except that I have it on this list.","NULL"
"780"," When  will see that list to Jim and he'll go, ""Um, well, uh,  90 or?""","NULL"
"781"," Welcome to the dark side, Kevin. Hold on, Jim's calling into the meeting here.","NULL"
"782"," I'm going to hang up on you and call in to the call.","NULL"
"783"," OK, be nice to Jim.","NULL"
"784"," He's throwing me under the bus now.","NULL"
"785"," You too.","NULL"
"786"," Bye.","NULL"
"787"," Bye.","NULL"
"788"," The three of us we're over to where we were.","NULL"
"789"," I don't have any, Grady.","NULL"
"790"," I wouldn't let you back, I'd  if you did.","NULL"
"791"," It's been too hot today for a sweater. Hi, who's on the call?","NULL"
"792"," Jim's on.","NULL"
"793"," Kathy Deacon.","NULL"
"794"," Cindy  .","NULL"
"795"," Do we have anything?","NULL"
"796"," Just a quick update on...","NULL"
"797"," Hi, who just joined?","NULL"
"798"," It's Kevin.","NULL"
"801"," Some of that may be fallout, some of it may not. I've spot-checked several other and they weren't fallout so far, so there's this new  to us. We need to figure out where that equipment's coming from or that  , may just be something we didn't have previously.","NULL"
"802"," It was not fallout, and it was not in the CL model. I know I spot-checked one yesterday. It was truly a  that we didn't receive from you all to import, and it didn't fallout, because we never received it. I don't know if they're all bad, but...","NULL"
"804"," They've replaced them with the new FTR one. I don't know if that's it. It's happened before, that they hire somebody new, they don't have the  receive  .","NULL"
"805"," Most of them are FTR-type hands","NULL"
"806"," That might be one reason, but we'll give you the official answer after we check.","NULL"
"807"," So far we've received about 203 Received Equipment and 60 of them fell out with Did Not  at this point.","NULL"
"808"," That was the only update we had for you all this morning. Do you all have anything for us?","NULL"
"809"," We're working on...Last night we were talking about the ship via CLLI codes, that starts with SA-type T  , the dimension was 500 some.","NULL"
"810"," We're working,  to see what would be a report that would be good for us to go through. We'll get that figured. Kim wanted to talk about those fallouts, try to do it as a group, so we're not having any conflicts. We can work definitely on that. I don't have anything else.","A"
"810"," We're working,  to see what would be a report that would be good for us to go through. We'll get that figured. Kim wanted to talk about those fallouts, try to do it as a group, so we're not having any conflicts. We can work definitely on that. I don't have anything else.","F"
"811"," Anybody else have anything?","NULL"
"812"," Susan, I sent you an email and got you  call.","NULL"
"813"," I probably haven't seen it. I have problems logging into my computer from the conference room this morning. If you sent it in the last 30 minutes, then I haven't seen it yet.","NULL"
"814"," I've got it, DJ. We don't have anything else, so wait for the other caller to go over it now.","NULL"
"815"," Is Drake with us?","NULL"
"816"," Are you asking if Drake is here? Yes, he's here.","NULL"
"817"," OK. We wanted to talk about two changes that were made to CTDI interface.","NULL"
"818"," Do we need to be here?","NULL"
"819"," You don't have to stay.","NULL"
"820"," We had some questions. We're trying to understand...Let me just pull it up.","NULL"
"821"," Can you see if Daryl is available?","NULL"
"823"," Yep.","NULL"
"825"," Yes.","NULL"
"826"," Correct? OK. The first one...I took notes, plus I double-checked the CTDI. We were under the impression, for those MRs, the finance issues and whatever the MR, that those could be worked through the existing code of send and receive. I was a little confused why that would be outside the scope.","NULL"
"828"," We hadn't decided. It could either be a service or a file, depending upon the size of that file, how much data...","NULL"
"829"," Were you sending it to them, or they were sending it to you?","NULL"
"830"," No, we were creating, depending on which way we were doing it. If we create a service, they would pull it whenever they wanted. If it was an FTP, then we would send it to them or put it on the FTP site, daily or however often it was run.","NULL"
"831"," To tackle the first one, first. You're saying that Mike suggested to use existing interfaces, is not appropriate or what...","NULL"
"832"," The existing interface doesn't change part numbers now. We would either have to change the existing interface to make it change part numbers -- which is not what the interface is designed for -- or we create a new interface to allow them to change part numbers. That's all they're doing with it.","NULL"
"833"," Either way, it'll be a change for us. It is not like we could just allow them to send it to the existing interface and it'll change the part with what they want.","NULL"
"834"," Wasn't that a two part thing? One with...","NULL"
"835"," Yeah, part or a serial number. VIN number.","NULL"
"836"," OK, but short of changing the part number, I thought the MR, the old part number would go out and the new one would come in.","NULL"
"837"," Yeah, that's...","NULL"
"838"," Would that really...?","NULL"
"839"," We seem to have one that's still bringing back in...","NULL"
"840"," We're just trying to make sure, before we accept the digital feed that.","NULL"
"841"," We still wouldn't change that.","NULL"
"842"," We might need an expert. We're a little confused.","NULL"
"843"," Their proposal was to send it out as one part number and then we would send another message, have it coming back in as a different part number. Still, the code doesn't change the part number when it comes in, it  that VIN and moves that VIN where it needs to be. It doesn't change the base equipment on that, that VIN.","F"
"844","  It wouldn't be treated like take the old one out and replace it with the new one?","NULL"
"845"," No. Basically it would  no change, the way they're saying to do it now. So like I said, it's either change that interface, or create a new interface.","NULL"
"846"," A new interface is safer. It's a safer way to do it.","NULL"
"847"," Yeah, because I don't think you want to change the part every time you get something in, because we wouldn't have any idea whether this was a part change or it's just receiving something in.","NULL"
"848"," I've got to see. Mike was thinking that those would be treated as two separate records. I hear what you're saying. We have a whole record leaving and a whole record coming in. To me, it would be changing the VIN.","NULL"
"849"," But you have to find it.","NULL"
"850"," ","NULL"
"851"," The other one,  would it be something we could do? Just run a query and let them pick it up? Isn't that all you're doing?","NULL"
"852"," Yeah.","NULL"
"853"," Have your part number and quantity. I just don't know why that would be such a significant code issue.","NULL"
"854"," We said it was three points.","NULL"
"855"," The whole thing?","NULL"
"856"," No. Three points for each of them. Don't look at me like that. I didn't make the query.","NULL"
"857"," I didn't make it either. I didn't make the query.","NULL"
"858","  until now.","NULL"
"859"," You can write, if you want to. Have Kim or Edward or someone write that query to do it, that's possible. Otherwise, like I said we create another service  or just sent it through with ITP.","NULL"
"860"," DJ, do we have enough for now? I guess I don't...","NULL"
"861"," Because we're not just pulling a query...","NULL"
"862"," ...with what we do.","NULL"
"863"," On the second one, I think we talked about, you wouldn't want an audited adjustment anyway, right?","NULL"
"864"," Jim. Right.","NULL"
"865"," We want  .","NULL"
"866"," But second, yes, there is a discrepancy. We were going to keep that manual anyway, correct? I think even Mike agreed.","NULL"
"867"," That's our understanding right now, is that it would just be a...It's just a way of being right and doing corrections at this point. That would be manual.","NULL"
"868"," All right. I guess, DJ, we have enough to review our options and get back with them.","NULL"
"869"," So, just out of curiosity, Adam and Drake. Why was this outside the scope of the interface? We just didn't clarify it up front?","NULL"
"870"," It was never asked for up front.","NULL"
"871"," First time we heard of it was last week.","NULL"
"872"," Last week was the first we heard of it. We never anticipated it or coded for it.","NULL"
"873"," In snapshot? It's not a bad idea. It's a good idea. It's just that like I said, we did not anticipate it.","NULL"
"874"," All of this stuff takes time, and time is running short. We'd anticipated this much work to do, and then we get six more days worth of work tacked on to it, and we have to be done by next Friday.","NULL"
"875"," I got it.","NULL"
"876"," So,  we will discuss it and let him know.","NULL"
"877"," OK, thanks. We'll talk to you guys later.","NULL"
"878"," Bye.","NULL"
"879"," Bye.","NULL"
"880"," Exactly.","NULL"
"881"," It was 60 degrees in July.","NULL"
"882"," 30 percent humidity.","NULL"
"883"," If the humidity wasn't so high, it wouldn't be as bad. I don't think so.","NULL"
"884"," We'll go ahead and get started. If  calls, he'd probably call me through the other terminal.","NULL"
"885"," Have you done any testing with CTDI yet, right? Are you all ready to test with CTDI? He's trying. He's calling again. I'm going to try this another way, Brian.","NULL"
"886"," OK.","NULL"
"887"," It keeps going back to you. Hold on. Hello?","NULL"
"888"," Hello. I thought you all died or something.","NULL"
"889"," No, now we're going to try...We didn't quite die. Now we're going to try...","NULL"
"890"," Nuclear bomb.","NULL"
"891"," So, Brian's on hold and I had  . If I hit conference now, and then go to Brian's, do you think it will work?","NULL"
"892"," Probably, it won't.","NULL"
"893"," We'll try it and see.","NULL"
"894"," You get them both on, we're going to have to call in to the other.","NULL"
"895"," Nah. That doesn't work. Let me try something else.","NULL"
"896"," OK.","NULL"
"897"," Wait, it keeps taking me back to you. Hold on.","NULL"
"898"," Do you see a ""Join"" button on there?","NULL"
"899"," I did. Let me go back.","NULL"
"900"," Did you hang up on Brian?","NULL"
"901"," No, I have Brian. Brian can you hear me?","NULL"
"902"," You still have me. I didn't hang up yet.","NULL"
"903"," OK. We still have  on hold. Hold on a second.","NULL"
"904"," Just in time for  .","NULL"
"905"," OK, who do I have on the call?","NULL"
"906"," You have Brian.","NULL"
"907"," Yay! It worked.","NULL"
"908"," Now, remember how you did it next time.","NULL"
"909"," Good luck with that.","NULL"
"910"," I'll have to hang up to call the other people, then.","NULL"
"911"," We have five minutes. We can do this in five minutes.","NULL"
"912"," I'm good. I'm doing clean up on back-taxes I have, here. I'm good.","NULL"
"913"," Which one?","NULL"
"914"," Don't know, the  . I'm just doing a mix...Bulk coding complete. I'm just doing.","NULL"
"915"," This one?","NULL"
"916"," Yeah.","NULL"
"917"," OK. You didn't finish it Friday? You didn't find your two hours?","NULL"
"918"," Couldn't find my two...Well, I got everything, the bulk of it done. I've got to make sure everything still works like it's supposed to.","NULL"
"919"," Once you're done with that, are you done with your stories, except for the testing?","NULL"
"920"," I think so.","NULL"
"921"," That's encouraging. Grady, you're done with all of your stories, right?","NULL"
"922"," When you want another one, we'll build.","NULL"
"923"," Whenever he gets done with this stuff. Drake?   . Working on the warehouse interface for non-serialized assets?","NULL"
"924"," Yes.","NULL"
"925"," That has to be done before you all can do testing with CTDI.","NULL"
"926"," Sure enough.","NULL"
"927"," When's that going to be done?","NULL"
"928"," Late Friday afternoon.","NULL"
"929"," Late Friday afternoon. Not awesome.","NULL"
"930"," In theory I could finish that today.","NULL"
"931"," That'd be good, because that's really the only thing that's holding up testing with CTDI. And we'll have a call with them tomorrow, at which time, hopefully we'll say we're ready to do testing, because seriously, I don't want to be doing testing next week when you all aren't here.","NULL"
"932"," It still needs work, though. It's going to work, though.","NULL"
"933","  Sure. Like the last interface worked.","NULL"
"934"," It did! It worked.","NULL"
"935"," Eventually. I mean, your stuff worked to begin with, and then...","NULL"
"936"," How's your stuff coming, Patrick?","NULL"
"937"," It's coming along. I got the second page, there. I'm getting all the old icons put on there, and after that is multi head, so, it's coming. It's got  , I think.","NULL"
"938"," Awesome.","NULL"
"939"," Brian, I don't have your name on here, so you never added any tasks for yours?","NULL"
"940"," No.","NULL"
"941"," He just didn't have anything to do.","NULL"
"942"," How's your stuff coming? I know there's been several emails going back and forth.","NULL"
"943"," Still got about 200 locations, so there's only one  . We still have  from the previous two versions released, to do some debugging and . It's not all of their pseudos ship-to codes.  pseudos.","NULL"
"944"," He did say that.","NULL"
"945"," So, I'm trying to work it out.","NULL"
"946"," Oh, and just let them go through without an address?","NULL"
"947"," Yeah. Exactly.","NULL"
"948"," For the pseudos.","NULL"
"949","  pseudo code.","NULL"
"950"," There's about 20,000 assets that reference locations...Well, no, actually, there's about 20,000 locations referenced by assets that don't exist in every location.  , so it's interesting. But anyway, so, we're working on locations.","NULL"
"951"," OK. We're going to have to hang up in a minute, but I do want to bring up...Who's doing the parts that aren't conversion for  ?","NULL"
"952"," We haven't worked at our conversions.","NULL"
"953"," Why? Are you restoring the database backup there, Brian, once you've done your stuff?","NULL"
"954"," I guess I can. We don't have to talk about that now, though.","NULL"
"955"," We don't. We've got to get off this call. My only concern is, Grady's on vacation next week and we're supposed to be doing this next Sunday, which, by the way, you and I need to get together and give them some kind of a, ""Yeah, you're going to be able to start work on Tuesday at name and date.""","NULL"
"956"," So, that's not this Sunday, but next Sunday.","NULL"
"957"," That's correct. A week from Sunday, but because Grady's not going to be here next week, that's what made me think about...We've got to get all our ducks in a row so we know who's doing what, and who's needs to be available on that Sunday. Or if anybody needs to be available on Sunday. They might be able to come in Monday morning and do stuff. All right. It's 9:30. We'll hang up on you guys and call them.","NULL"
"958"," All right.","NULL"
"959"," Thanks, bye.","NULL"
"960"," Please enter your PIN.","NULL"
"961"," Hi. Who's on the call?","NULL"
"962"," Jim's on.","NULL"
"963"," Hey Jim.","NULL"
"964","  here.","NULL"
"965"," Hi,  .","NULL"
"966"," DJ's on.","NULL"
"967"," Hey DJ.","NULL"
"968"," Do you know  ?","NULL"
"969"," Hi. Who just joined?","NULL"
"970"," This is Brian.","NULL"
"971"," Hey Brian.","NULL"
"972"," Kevin.","NULL"
"973"," Kevin.","NULL"
"974"," I don't have anything on my list for Frontier this morning. Brian, did you have anything that we needed to ask them on this call, or do we need another call to talk about conversion?","NULL"
"975"," This might be a two-minute question, so I think there was about, let me look real quick, it will take me a few seconds to get it up. I may need a couple more seconds.","NULL"
"977"," Kevin. As we got back to the source, I guess I don't remember a pseudo ever being used. Do you?  make the request. I guess I'm leaning towards the...","NULL"
"978"," I'm shipping to a pseudo?","NULL"
"979"," Is that what Brian was talking about? The via  location.","NULL"
"980"," Yeah. I'm not aware of shipping to a pseudo, so I can treat those similarly to the way that we're treating the ones that we know how to ship to, information, but we don't have it, and I can put ship unknown on the via location.","NULL"
"981"," That way somebody can go in there and prioritize whether or not  to that direct location or somewhere else.","NULL"
"982"," If that's OK with you guys  , so I need to send that out to the group, so it's going to be shipped unknown all together...","NULL"
"983"," I owe you guys an email explaining that, so I'll send that to you, and you can  to whoever you need to. I'll explain the pseudo exchange  to  . OK? .","F"
"984"," I don't think we had anything else for you all this morning. Do you all have anything for us that we need to discuss?","NULL"
"985"," Brian, I've got here, I think he deciphered these Verizon three warehouses, but I'll double check and  arrange to send something. I know they went back and forth a few times. It would be the  as far as what they're taking in to the setting, so I'll get back with you on that.","NULL"
"986"," One urgent thing we have is Brenda's  back in my group. I don't know if Adam's on.","NULL"
"987"," We can't make them send...","NULL"
"990"," So you're saying that you've received new equipment  by looking at the wires? By wired information? But you haven't seen any of that evidence in LCAM, is that right?","A"
"990"," So you're saying that you've received new equipment  by looking at the wires? By wired information? But you haven't seen any of that evidence in LCAM, is that right?","F"
"991"," Correct.  .","NULL"
"992"," It's still the same situation I reported last time. At this point, I haven't received any interface messages that indicate new equipment. I sent that message to Ron to get an update on when we would be receiving those, but I haven't received any contact back regarding new equipment.","NULL"
"993"," I'm going to check with them and see if that's something we're missing here. Because it's new, it's coming direct from the vendor, they would place the unique bar code  they had it in, so I would assume  pulled it out of...","NULL"
"994"," He'll pull it out wired, and we'll see how he does this. Check with the original PO to make sure they're all received, which normally isn't...We'll check on it.","NULL"
"995"," You'll let us know what Ron says?","NULL"
"996"," Yeah.","NULL"
"997"," Thanks.","NULL"
"998"," That's all I had.  , go ahead.","NULL"
"999"," The only thing I had, I asked Drake for some of that information about moving databases. I'll take a look at that later today, and let you know if it works.","NULL"
"1000"," Nobody else had anything?","NULL"
"1001"," All Right. Thanks everybody. We'll talk to you guys later.","NULL"

"1008"," Much bigger issues regarding Windows 10, the hardware aspects of this. What kind of hardware we'll keep it on, Support, or  for support, all that logistics part of it. ","NULL"
"1009"," Software side, Michael said he's got some kinks he's got to work on the entire map server stuff. Do some research for Windows 10, see if all hope is lost. We're fixing an issue that's not even compatible on this version, so that's very frustrating. ","NULL"
"1010"," That's pretty much it. I will talk to Michael a little bit later to see...he's researching a program to replace IIS.  It's really fun. As soon as he lets me know...I'm just really curious if it's going to work on your computer or not.","NULL"
"1011"," OK, since...","NULL"
"1012"," ","NULL"
"1013"," It was an expensive trip.","NULL"
"1014"," ","NULL"

"1167"," The change here is to put estimate on here. So, the story is...Why does it say  ?","NULL"
"1168"," So, what they do today, the reason they want this, is they go in and they select plugs and hardwire combined, and they retire them. When they retire them, they go over to  , and when they go to  , they have to have an estimate on them.","A"
"1170"," Estimate?","NULL"
"1171"," I mean for the estimate. It's defaulting it to something. But for hardwire, it requires them to enter one, so the change is to put it on here, and if they enter one, use the one they enter. If they don't enter one, still use the default, like it's doing today.","NULL"
"1172"," But that would only apply to hardwire.","NULL"
"1173"," No, plugs. This only applies to plugs. If I went back and do a hardwire, then it'll have estimate through here.","NULL"

"1175"," ...but what if they choose...","NULL"

"1183"," I'm thinking that scenario. That choose hardwire and plug. I'll put the estimate field up here, which, we want that now...","NULL"
"1184"," They have to have it for hardwire.","NULL"
"1185"," They have to have it for hardwire, but they don't need it for plugs, so if they put a value in here that's only applicable for hardwire...","NULL"
"1186"," No.","NULL"
"1187"," No.","NULL"
"1188"," Oh, it applies to plugs too.","NULL"
"1189"," Yes. What you're doing is, you're changing it so that when they select, regardless, you're going to have estimate show up here.","NULL"
"1190"," Whatever they...","NULL"
"1191"," If everything in their result set is plugs, and they don't enter an estimate in it, and they hit save...","NULL"
"1192"," It goes to default.","NULL"

"1194"," That'd be all hardwire, or hardwire and plug?","NULL"
"1195"," That's right. You're not going to require it for plugs if it's only plugs, which you would still  .","NULL"

"1213"," Today they reverse retire and then transfer to 1220. Step one is reverse retiring and transfer to 1220. Then, step two is updating the frame.","NULL"
"1214"," On this screen for reverse retire, this what we want.","NULL"

"1251"," There a danger in doing that?","NULL"
"1252"," Would they need the information for plugs?","NULL"
"1253"," I would prefer it to be consistent if we can make it consistent. It makes it easier, whether they use it or not, as long as it does work if they do choose to use it.

"1261"," ...but the plug is not...?","NULL"
"1262"," Yeah. Today, for hardwire the screen has frame, but for plugs it does not.","NULL"

"1353"," I don't know. It's, if you're changing the frame it can't be general.","NULL"
"1354"," Yeah, but this is general change. One of them was general change and one of them was that change the frame.","NULL"

"1366"," Right. On this screen, if they come in and already change on here, the frame then you would throw and error message and tell them, frame those dates are not a general change. You would require one of these other fields to be changed at that point.","NULL"
"1367"," The frame by itself...","NULL"
"1368"," Right. You would not allow frame by themselves. I still don't know why we did it at three days, but that's OK. It's what they said they'd pay for.  I just don't know why. So annoying  .","NULL"

"1405"," Right now you cannot retire inventory  equipment. You have to move it to in service and then retire it. This one I remember, because I asked him about this 166. I sent him a bazillion emails on it. I remember, when I finally understood it. It makes perfect sense...","NULL"

"1415"," Yeah, reuse because she says that up here. New RC five U.  Not confusing at all, because that's the whole deal, right?

Today we have to go through these various steps down here in order to do that.","NULL"
"1416","  retired, wherever it is.","NULL"
"1417"," Yes, because we did have that discuss about, ""Do you want to retire this stuff at the  Garage where it was never installed?"" They were like, ""Yeah."" So, we're going to retire it wherever it is.","NULL"

"1432"," Other people put diddly. I'm like, ""That doesn't tell me anything. I still don't know what you did."" We have a lot in here now.

"1436"," Technically it is, because I started on it. These stories don't write themselves.  I spent hours with  going through it. They don't. I was thinking for this one, maybe we would do three, or maybe four-week iterations? If we really had started the 14th, three-week iteration goes there. If we do a four-week iteration, it goes there.","NULL"

"1439"," When's he supposed to come through?","NULL"
"1440"," The 17th or the 24th. That actually works out well. The 24th will end our iteration, but we'll actually need to be through on the 17th. We can do four-week iterations. I'll add them in as four week iterations.","NULL"
"1441"," Then I'll need you all to go in and put your stories into the iteration when you think you'll do them. I will try to get test cases in here.  was also going to write the test cases for these, but I really need to sit with him for that.","NULL"
"1442"," I was just saying four because if you said three is going to put us, clash us right with the, when we're dealing with the frontier, we're at the beginning of April.","NULL"
"1443"," The beginning of April is next week.","NULL"
"1444"," I know. I just want to say four weeks is better.","NULL"

"1448"," Right, so you need to do one story before a week from, two weeks from tomorrow, right? I'll add those in. I'll let you know when they're there. You all can put your stuff in there.

"1459"," Hello.","NULL"
"1460"," Hello.","NULL"
"1461"," First, we are going to talk about that QUEL that they want for us writing a SQL that will update they're database. I think I sent the email onto you this morning.","NULL"
"1462"," The one on disconnects?","NULL"
"1463"," Yes.","NULL"
"1464"," Yes.","NULL"
"1465"," Smiley recognizes that this will be chargeable work. What they want is they have these 22,000 disconnects. They want to retire all the items that are not related to the central office  code, and not do anything to the ones that are already color coded.","NULL"
"1466"," Here's the spreadsheet that they sent us. Right now, it's filtered by price, but you can take that off. The guy that was working on it was going for the high-dollar items first. What he wants us to do is take all of these assets and write a script that will retire them in LCAM.","NULL"
"1467"," Is  , and so on and so forth?","NULL"
"1468"," Yes. Yeah, they have to be journalized. He did say that.","NULL"
"1469"," What do the color codes mean? They're not related to CO?","NULL"
"1470"," Yes. It's two things. In the first file editor, they have this north, south, east and west location groups. If it's in one of those location groups, then you wouldn't do anything with it. If it's not in one of those location groups, then you would retire it.","NULL"
"1471"," And  on the spreadsheet if they've color coded it then they've already touched it. It's always possible.","NULL"
"1472"," Filtered by color?","NULL"
"1473"," OK, yeah. He's already done something to all of these.","NULL"
"1474"," Don't touch them.","NULL"
"1475"," They don't want us to touch the ones that they've put color on, because they're manually researching on them, figuring out if they want to retire them or not.","NULL"
"1476"," And color code them. Yeah, can you filter it in that?","NULL"
"1477"," Filter by no color?","NULL"
"1478"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1479"," There was a no color option. No fill. So, those...","NULL"
"1480"," Those 22, 247, then you go...","NULL"
"1481"," And if they're not...","NULL"
"1482"," Yeah, if they're not in...","NULL"
"1483"," The realm.","NULL"
"1484"," These profile editor location groups, then you retire them. You give them back the ones that you didn't touch, so that they know they still need to go and manually look at those.","NULL"
"1485"," Don't they know by the ones that are...oh, because they don't know about what's in the north, south, east, west? OK, I got you.","NULL"
"1486"," I would think we would give them back, but for one spreadsheet that says, ""Here's all the stuff we've retired, in case you want to double check it. Here's all the stuff we didn't touch, that was in your spreadsheet."" Right?","NULL"
"1487"," What do we know about the answers? What do we have on there?","NULL"
"1488"," I don't know nothing, because that's all I want to  . ","NULL"
"1489"," I have seen you guys on location.","NULL"
"1490"," And you've got to clone but I don't know if that helps us any.","NULL"
"1491"," We have a price that is the original, the price?","NULL"
"1492"," It's probably not going to equal something that's in...","NULL"
"1493"," I don't either.","NULL"
"1494"," Just first guess.  .","NULL"
"1495"," A silly question.","NULL"
"1496"," There was other calls, or it had...","NULL"
"1497"," So, we had a  .","NULL"
"1498"," Taxes.","NULL"
"1499"," DD column.","NULL"
"1500"," This is related to the other system that he's looking stuff up in, like this bridge here.","NULL"
"1501"," These are network trends equipment. These are more like smart jacks, or like shells that are out on the customer prem. I understand it's because this is what's happening. They only have the people there in the customer prem and they removed the equipment.","NULL"
"1502"," There was always a big debate on the equipment is not worth to roll a truck, to go out and actually get. They're so far behind on it. They don't have the people to do it. They want to clean the records off.","NULL"
"1503"," That's $500 filter that he had on there. Apparently, if it's $500 it's worth rolling a truck for.  If it's under that, it's not. That's very helpful, Caleb. ","NULL"
"1504"," I thought he said something about that they don't want you to touch it if it's related to CO, the component.","NULL"
"1505"," Yeah, that's the part of the email where the way that we know that it's related to a CO is because if it's in the north, south, east or west location group on their system then that's the COs that he doesn't want us to touch.","NULL"
"1506"," Oh, I just want to say I could probably go in and get a copy of all the COs that Bill had and by the common language game.","NULL"
"1507"," You all can correct me if I'm wrong but probably what we will do is we'll go in their system. We'll pull this north, south, east and west location groups. We'll filter the spreadsheet about that and then we'll confirm with Smiley that this is what you mean. We are not going to touch these. Then, we'll go forward from there. That's what I would think we would do. ","NULL"
"1508"," Yeah, that's the same thing. The north, south, east, west would be...It's just a list of all 50 something COs that they don't have in their common language names.","NULL"
"1509"," OK, you're all trying to think how you would actually do this or you think you'll just talk about location and this equipment. Can we use a vintage or it does it matter?","NULL"
"1510"," The north, south, east, west each have a group of  that's associated with them? Am I understanding that correctly?","NULL"
"1511"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1512"," Yes, and for all the  .","NULL"
"1513"," We can ask Smiley, ""OK, for the north, south, east, west, get the list of all the  belonging...""","NULL"
"1514"," We can do it.","NULL"
"1515"," No need, we don't need him. It's in the...","NULL"
"1516"," It's in the database.","NULL"
"1517"," OK.","NULL"
"1518"," We can log into the database. I got it. By the way, I can do that now.","NULL"
"1519"," OK, so we could take those  .","NULL"
"1520"," We can take those  . Get the ones out of here based on those indecipherable 08:50] . Those are the ones we...","NULL"
"1521"," Exclude those.","NULL"
"1522"," Exclude, so what's left over are the ones that we would need to work with.","NULL"
"1523"," That's right. I guess the first question is, is this really chargeable work because they pay for maintenance. Smiley's under the impression that...","NULL"
"1524"," This isn't maintenance stuff.","NULL"
"1525"," OK. They did pay a license fee. I just don't whether it covers. That's how I'm asking is. Would you think that this is something that we would charge them to do or would it be something that he would say...?","NULL"
"1526"," First thought is, ""Yeah, we charge for it.""","NULL"
"1527"," That's fine because he's under the impression that it is chargeable so just saying it's not chargeable would be like a...It would be better for him but he's expecting to pay for it.","NULL"
"1528"," Who wants to finance maintenance? I guess, is my question.","NULL"
"1529"," The maintenance is doing stuff to the app? I guess so. You ask  about this.","NULL"
"1530"," This one escapes the edge for me. It could go either way. That's why I'm asking.","NULL"
"1531"," When we mention maintenance, it also includes correcting their data?","NULL"
"1532"," Only if we messed it up.","NULL"
"1533"," Yes, that's right.","NULL"
"1534"," Only if we messed it up, which in this case, we didn't mess it up. If we were to estimate it, what's the estimate?","NULL"
"1535"," I wouldn't say we're in two points.","NULL"
"1536"," Oh, yeah.","NULL"
"1537"," Two. That sounds reasonable to me. I was thinking one or two at least, it depends on how much testing you have to do.","NULL"
"1538"," Yeah, we'll take  . Put a lot of queries and we'd make sure it's right.","NULL"
"1539"," Yeah, a lot of verification.","NULL"
"1540"," We'll have to write it on their test system.","NULL"
"1541"," Here's the other thing that's going on. We have a request in now to get their production database. As part of that request, they want us to restore their production to their test again. If they're willing to wait on this until we restore their latest production to their test, then we're a lot closer to their production when we run the script.","NULL"
"1542"," We run it against our test. See what happens. Send him the results say, ""Do they look good?"" We've run against their test, be absolutely sure. Have them look at it there, and then we can run against production.","NULL"
"1543"," That's reasonable.","NULL"
"1544"," Chris Barry will be back on the 24th. Any  stuff, she will be available again once we ran it on their test, to confirm that looked how she's expecting it to look. Chris Barry is their accountant. She's their main accounting person.","NULL"
"1545"," She's like a contractor. She took seven weeks off. She does this every year though, she takes off big blocks of time. She just doesn't work.","NULL"
"1546"," Eight weeks.","NULL"
"1547"," Do what? It was eight weeks?","NULL"
"1548"," Yeah, every year. She goes to Florida. They have a house down there so she goes down there for two months.","NULL"
"1549"," Nice.","NULL"
"1550"," My question was, on the spreadsheet, all the items status say complete. Is that complete at LCAM?","NULL"
"1551"," No.","NULL"
"1552"," The clause, that are there. The script will have to go in and complete these closeout too, if they're still open in LCAM, correct?","NULL"
"1553"," They didn't ask for that.","NULL"
"1554"," Well I've been telling you, you've got to run it. These clause are associated with this equipment. You're going to have to clean out...","NULL"
"1555"," I would imagine the clause have already been...Are these disconnect clauses or something?","NULL"
"1556"," Yeah. These are all disconnect. Sorry if I didn't make that clear.","NULL"
"1557"," That was one more thing. I would be checking and see in LCAM, log into the system to see if we can find this equipment under these clause to be disconnected. Pending disconnects.","NULL"
"1558"," I realize we didn't do the actual disconnect.","NULL"
"1559"," This isn't an LCAM status. This is the status over in the other system they pull this information from.","NULL"
"1560"," Did the emails say that they're disconnect?","NULL"
"1561"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1562"," Yeah, disconnects.","NULL"
"1563"," It's probably called  . That's the other system probably where they are getting this information from. Where the tech goes in and says, ""I did the work."" Then nothing ever happens.","NULL"
"1564"," Completed special disconnects isn't even the name of it. Completed is they've done whatever work they're going to do, I guess.","NULL"
"1565"," They did the work, but they didn't do anything in LCAM, is what you're saying.","NULL"
"1566"," He did tell me that the completed column didn't apply to LCAM. I don't know if they're completed or not. I have not looked at the data at all.","NULL"
"1567"," I definitely wouldn't listen to voicemail then. We've got to go find the clause, find the  disconnects. Mark those as complete.","NULL"
"1568"," Only if we did have the clause in here.","NULL"
"1569"," We've been meaning to find this specific equipment associated with that clause.","NULL"
"1570"," OK, so that's more complicated.","NULL"
"1571"," Otherwise we would be social people.","NULL"
"1572"," Hopefully those assets have not been grabbed by something else.","NULL"
"1573"," We'll see. It's not terribly complicated. It's a little more complicated.","NULL"
"1574"," Are we thinking three months to two?","NULL"
"1575"," I think two is...","NULL"
"1576"," You think two will be fine?","NULL"
"1577"," Yes.","NULL"
"1578"," I can ask him. I can say, ""We talked about this, would you want us to verify that the clause are closed in LCAM as well, or is that not part of what we're doing?"" And say, it's two if we don't have to worry about the clause, it's three if we have to worry about the clause.","NULL"
"1579"," I can't say it's two, and then it's two.","NULL"
"1580"," I think we all agree it wasn't always bigger than a one.","NULL"
"1581"," What did you say  ?","NULL"
"1582"," Does LCAM store the clause?","NULL"
"1583"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1584"," I would think that in order to do an actual retirement, you would have to emulate the retirement screen in LCAM, which I think requires the clause.","NULL"
"1585"," It doesn't require the clause to be retired.","NULL"
"1586"," The retire doesn't need the clause.","NULL"
"1587"," But if you go, the clause just stay in LCAM as open forever, right? Then you've got a dirty  .","NULL"
"1588"," Yeah.","NULL"
"1589"," We still have the list of clause. We can go mark them all as being complete. If that's the only thing that's on the clause.","NULL"
"1590"," You need the clause and the location.","NULL"
"1591"," ...has two different locations and two...","NULL"
